# Content Guidelines

## Content Collections

Content is managed through Astro's content collections in `src/content/`. Each collection should:

- Have a proper schema defined
- Include all required metadata
- Use consistent frontmatter structure

## Assets

- Place images in `src/assets/` for optimization
- Use public/ only for files that need direct URL access
- Optimize images before adding them to the project

## Markdown

- Follow rules in [.markdownlint.json](mdc:.markdownlint.json)
- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Include alt text for images
- Keep line length reasonable
