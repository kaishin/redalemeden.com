## Neo Samurai Blog Migration (87 posts total)

Track migration in batches of 12 posts. For each post:

1. Clean up formatting and improve writing while keeping original style/tone
2. Add proper front matter (title, pubDate, tags: ["neosamurai"], isArchived: true)
3. Move to `src/content/blog/YYYY/MM/slug/index.md`

### Writing Cleanup Recipe

Apply these transformations to make writing more mature and deliberate:

**Remove rambling/casual language:**

- Cut phrases like "as you might be wondering," "well I guess," "truth is," "only god knows"
- Remove apologetic language: "I went into the trouble of," "I couldn't help but"
- Eliminate uncertain phrasing: "…ahem…", "!!!", multiple exclamation marks
- Remove self-conscious asides and excessive commentary

**Tighten structure:**

- Get straight to the point—no meandering intros
- Remove redundant explanations (e.g., don't explain what you're about to explain)
- Condense verbose descriptions into concise statements
- Cut tangential information that doesn't serve the main point

**Improve titles:**

- Make titles descriptive and direct
- Avoid clickbait-style titles with ellipses or excessive punctuation
- Use clear, professional language

**Preserve:**

- Personal voice and opinions (keep "I" statements where they matter)
- Important content like lyrics, lists, quotes, or technical details
- Links and attributions
- Cultural/historical context that adds value

**Examples:**

- Before: "Even though I am not really into the Japanese Pop scene, I stumble from time to time upon..."
- After: "While browsing [source], I stumbled upon..."
- Before: "Can you read Japanese? You'd better spare your time and stop reading..."
- After: "If you can read Japanese and own a Nintendo DS..."
- Before: "I went into the trouble of checking the history of the page and got this wonderful description"
- After: "I checked the page history and found some highlights"
