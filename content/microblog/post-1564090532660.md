Not long ago, I started toying with the idea of rolling out a custom-built microblog instead of relying on third party platforms. Today, I am happy to launch a modest first iteration.

I will keep my single-user Mastodon instance and Twitter for the time being, but I will use them mainly to syndicate posts that will be published here first.
