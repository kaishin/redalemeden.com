By default, `git fetch` gets an updated list of remote branches from the remote and sets up remote branch references locally. However, it doesn't delete stale references that no longer have a counterpart on the remote. Trying to get rid of these using the `git push -f origin:branch-name` command will fail with a `remote ref does not exist` error.

To delete stale remote references, you need to pass the `--prune` option to `fetch` like so:

```sh
git fetch --prune
- [deleted]  (none) -> origin/branch-name
```
