I absolutely love the work that the SSWG has been doing, and [this annual update](https://swift.org/blog/sswg-update/) published by [Tanner](https://twitter.com/tanner0101) is a testament to this.

The lack of consensus on how to write server-side Swift has been dividing its fledgling community; something that the SSWG has been working towards solving since its inception.

I am hoping to be able to contribute more to this ecosystem, and I urge anyone who's interested in making Swift more ubiquitous to do the same.
