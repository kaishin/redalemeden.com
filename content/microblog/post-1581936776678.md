There is a new trend emerging in the ~~Design~~ Dribbble community. And somebody decided to call it _neumorphism_*. And it _sucks_.

I have absoultely no qualms with visual experimentation, depth in user interfaces, or the specific effects used in this new trend. But I can't help but feel put off by this incessant, collective infatuation with new trends. It's not healthy for anyone caught up in it, especially when they get named and things get out of hand.

(*) Seriously, _who_ comes up with these names?
