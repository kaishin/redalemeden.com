There is a new trend emerging in the ~~design~~ Dribbble community. And some creative souls decided to call it *neumorphism*.

I have absolutely no qualms with visual experimentation, depth in user interfaces, or the specific effects used in this new trend. But I can't help but feel put off by this incessant, collective infatuation with fads in UI design circles. It's not healthy for anyone caught up in it, especially newcomers who have yet to find their creative footing.

If you are just starting out as a UI designer, learn to ignore design trends. You can thank me later.
