There is a new trend emerging in the ~~Design~~ Dribbble community. And some creative souls decided to call it *neumorphism*. And it *sucks*.

I have absoultely no qualms with visual experimentation, depth in user interfaces, or the specific effects used in this new trend. But I can't help but feel put off by this incessant, collective infatuation with new trends. It's not healthy for anyone caught up in it, especially newcomers who have yet to find their footing in the field.
