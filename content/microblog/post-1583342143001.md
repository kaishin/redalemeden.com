I am slowly starting to appreciate the versatility of the CSS Grid layout module. For instance, in [this commit](https://github.com/kaishin/swiftui.directory/commit/aaba0e5e96d7642ed25560cc2456890b1cb49f8b) I replaced a `flex` grid that required finicky media queries and margin gymnastics with essentially three lines of code using `grid`. Here is a variable-free version of what I ended up with:

```css
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(20rem, 1fr));
grid-gap: 1rem;
```
The result can be seen [here](https://swiftui.directory). Not only this achieves the exact same result as my previous `flex` solution, but it is cleaner and doesn't use any media queries. Sign me up!
