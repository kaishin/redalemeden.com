Today was officially my first day as an indie. Even though the timing might be less than ideal, I can’t help but feel excited about it—especially whenever I take a gander at my meeting-free calendar.

I have drafted some plans leading to this, but I didn’t have a global pandemic in any of them. Silly me.

Then again, a quarantine is exactly what I need to start chiseling away at one or two behemoth projects that have been staring me down for the better part of last year.

Wish me luck. And f☆ck COVID-19.
