You know those placeholder words used when writing tests or documentation for software programs? They are called _metasyntactic variables_, and today I picked up some brand new ones beside the usual _foo_, _bar_, _baz_, and _qux_: _corge, grault, garply, waldo, fred, plugh, xyzzy,_ and _thud_ ([source](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3092.txt)). The last one is definitely a keeper.

```swift
struct Thud: Thuddable { ... }
```

I remember the first time I was introduced to _toto_—the most used metasyntatcic variable in French programming literature—and made fun of how silly and immature it sounded; a shortsighted take in retrospect.
