My good friend [Mikael Muszynski](https://twitter.com/linduxed) sent me this nugget about [metasyntactic variables](https://redalemeden.com/microblog/post-1584485660627):

> I was reminded of the fact that companies which speak primarily in Swedish have their own metasyntactic variables!
>
> The code will generally be written in English, but instead of `foo` and `bar`, they have a clever system:
>
> "Apa" is the word for monkey [in Swedish], and not only is it a somewhat amusing word, it also happens to start with the letter “a”!
>
> So the pattern goes `apa`, `bepa`, `cepa`, `depa`…

Clever indeed.
