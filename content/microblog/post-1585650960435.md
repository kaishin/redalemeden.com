While browsing [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) yesterday, I couldn't help but get a strong mid-90s, _GeoCities_-esque, vibe as I scrolled past the animated GIF thumbnails.

I get it. This is how the [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) works, and the Internet loves them GIFs. But when everything is screaming for your attention at the same time, the whole thing becomes a kitschy, obnoxious mess.
