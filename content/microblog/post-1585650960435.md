While browsing [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) a while ago, I couldn't help but get a strong mid-90s, _GeoCities_-esque, vibe as I scrolled past the animated GIF thumbnails. Do I like it? Not so sure. Does it make the website as a whole and the content feel more kitschy than it probably is? Definitely.

Allowing your users to do something to stand out, _free of charge_, is basically asking everyone to join in the fun. That's how the attention economy works.
