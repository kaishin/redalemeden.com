Here are some of the things I learnt this week, in the order I’ve noted them down. This week I created a separate section for programming to keep things tidy.

* _Contact tracing_. A joint initiative by Apple and Google to help health organizations throughout the world slow down the spread of COVID-19. This [excellent entry](https://nshipster.com/contact-tracing/) on NSHipster is a good place to start if you’re interested in the nitty-gritty details. The official documentation itself can be found [here](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing/).
* [Last week](https://redalemeden.com/microblog/post-1586715980964) I mentioned free access to the ACM Digital Library during COVID-19. This week I stumbled upon [this list](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/04/13/temporarily-free-content/) of similar offers compiled by Michael Tsai.

### Programming

* The relationship between `size`, `stride`, and `alignment` in the memory layout of Swift types, thanks to this [excellent article](https://swiftunboxed.com/internals/size-stride-alignment/) by [Greg Heo](https://gregheo.com).
* In Swift _Combine_, you can filter out _nil_ values using `.compactMap { $0 }` ([reference](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3204698-compactmap)). I was using `filter(_:)` before but that still requires force-unwrapping the value in subsequent operations.

*[COVID-19]: Corona Virus Disease 19
