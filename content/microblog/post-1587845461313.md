I'm genuinely excited to see Chris Krycho [adopt](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/this-week-i-learned-1/) the format I've been recently experimenting with on this microblog. I’ve learnt a lot from reading Chris’ essays and journal entries[^1], and I am looking forward to reading more of these.

[^1]: That’s also where I got the [assumed audience](https://redalemeden.com/microblog/post-1570576215962) idea from.
