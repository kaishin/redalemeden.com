Here are some of the things I learnt this week, in the order I’ve noted them down.

* The words "_esoteric_" and "_niche_" do not have the same connotations. I used the two interchangeably in the past, and that resulted in some really awkward sentences. Thanks anonymous reader for the tip!

### Programming

* How the layout algorithm works in SwiftUI stack views. Huge props to [Adrian Zubarev](https://twitter.com/DevAndArtist) for making that task [easier](https://github.com/UndefinedAlgorithm/swift-legacy-user-interface/blob/master/Sources/Layout/Layouts/HStackLayout.swift) for me. I will be sharing more about these findings, and the context that motivated them, in the near future.
* Database normalization and normal forms, through various articles and resources, including [this one](https://www.lifewire.com/database-normalization-basics-1019735). I’ve intentionally tried to stay as far as possible from databases for the past 10 years, but now I feel like I am missing out on a fundamental aspect of building server-side software.
* After all these years, CSS is [still](https://github.com/bansal-io/pattern.css) [fun](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/).
