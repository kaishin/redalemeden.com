It’s relatively easy to write about solutions. Tips and tricks. How to do X or Y. But it’s harder to write about problems. That’s because understanding problems to a level where they can be distilled requires much more rigor and experience.

When learning about a new topic, it’s far more worthwhile to understand the problems, challenges, and tradeoffs than to build a repertoire of solutions. Doing the latter without the former might work in the short and mid-term, but on the long run it is very likely to hinder personal and professional growth.
