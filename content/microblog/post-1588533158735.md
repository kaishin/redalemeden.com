Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order I’ve noted them down.

* _The Blub Paradox_ (thanks [Kim](https://www.burgestrand.se)!). Coined by Paul Graham in his 2001 essay “[Beating The Averages](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html)”, this concept refers to the inability of a programmer using a hypothetical mid-level language, called _Blub_, to:

  * Use a lower-level language due to lack of features they are familiar with in Blub.
  * Realize that they are looking at a higher-level language when they evaluate one.

  I have some reservations about this one, based on my own experience, but it’s a nice tidbit nonetheless.

* I did some reading on flying machines this week and picked up a new word: _[ornithopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithopter)_.

* I almost feel ashamed for not knowing this one until this week[^1]: [deuteragonist](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/deuteragonist) and [tritagonist](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tritagonist).

* [This answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-important-things-involved-in-delivering-a-great-software-library/answer/Dave-Abrahams?share=c027457a) by [Dave Abrahams](https://daveabrahams.com) to a Quora question about the most important things involved in delivering a great software library. If I had to pick only one, that would be “rigorously document“.

* The _.org_ <abbr title="Top-level Domain">TLD</abbr> is [saved](https://www.icann.org/news/blog/icann-board-withholds-consent-for-a-change-of-control-of-the-public-interest-registry-pir)!

[^1]: Not gonna lie, it's a fairly prevalent feeling throughout these updates.
