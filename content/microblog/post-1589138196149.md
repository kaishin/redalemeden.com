Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order I’ve noted them down.

* <ruby>自粛<rt>じしゅく</rt>疲<rt>つか</rt>れ</ruby> (jishuku-tsukare). An expression that’s gaining momentum right now in Japanese media, meaning _getting tired of voluntary confinement_.

### Programming

* Visual explanations go a long way in demystifying tricky topics such as [floating numbers]([Floating Point Visually Explained](https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/index.html)) and [regular expressions](https://refrf.shreyasminocha.me).

* JavaScript frameworks are costly, argues [this well-researched piece](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-04-21-the-cost-of-javascript-frameworks/) by Tim Kadlec. One would think that performance tends to get better over time in technology, but that doesn't seem to be the case in JS-land.

* I picked up some LaTeX this week for writing mathematical notations and [this cheatsheet](https://davidhamann.de/2017/06/12/latex-cheat-sheet/) came in quite handy.
