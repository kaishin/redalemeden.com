Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order I’ve noted them down.

* How the _MissingNo._ sprite [is rendered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI50XUeN6QE) in Pokémon. If you are into retro games and programming, I highly recommend this channel.

* The _Scunthorpe problem_ is, according to Wikipedia, “the unintentional blocking of websites, e-mails, forum posts or search results by a spam filter or search engine because their text contains a string of letters that appear to have an obscene or otherwise unacceptable meaning.” Via [Scunthorpe Sans](https://vole.wtf/scunthorpe-sans/).

* How HTTP/3 and QUIC work. I hadn’t heard about QUIC until earlier this week and watching [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idViw4anA6E) by [Daniel Stenberg](https://daniel.haxx.se) was a perfect way to catch up. Thanks [Alaa](https://twitter.com/aldn00) for the tip!

### Programming

* Global variables in Swift are _lazy_—it’s [in the docs even](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html#ID263). I don’t know how I ended up with the assumption that they are eagerly evaluated (thanks [again](/microblog/post-1588533158735), [Kim](https://www.burgestrand.se)!).
