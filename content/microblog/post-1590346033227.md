Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order I’ve noted them down.	

* _Concern trolls_. I had never heard this expression before until I read about it in the context of US politics. It refers to a person who, in order to be accepted, pretends to agree with a group of people about a given topic, only to constantly seek to sow doubt and confusion among their ranks, disguising their ruse as “concerns”.

### Programming

* If there is something that can be exploited, you can rest assured that unscrupulous Web sites will exploit it. The [latest episode](https://nullsweep.com/why-is-this-website-port-scanning-me/) is port scanning through WebSockets. I didn’t even know this was possible, and I am kind of bummed that browsers keep encroaching more and more on operating system territory. I mean, who in their right mind wants a random Web site to control their device [vibration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Vibration_API)?

* _[Boolean blindness](https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2015/01/31/boolean-blindness/)_ and why booleans are not always the right choice in the context of data modeling. Via Matt Diephouse’s [“You Might Not Want a Boolean”](https://matt.diephouse.com/2020/05/you-might-not-want-a-boolean/).
