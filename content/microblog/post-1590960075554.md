Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order I’ve noted them down.

* The difference between input and output randomness in game design ([video](https://youtu.be/dwI5b-wRLic)). The gist of it that randomness that occurs _before_ a player action is referred to as _input_ randomness—a prominent example being procedural level generation—while randomness that occurs _after_ user action is called _output_ randomness, such as the case with loot boxes and success rates.

### Programming

* I’ve been using Markdown for years, but I never realized you could add image titles like this: `![Alt](/url/to/image.jpg "A title")`. Granted, I usually avoid using the title attribute for the reasons [outlined here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#The_title_attribute). 
* [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html) became a lot easier to work with since the last time I used it, which was before `NSPersistentContainer` for those familiar with the framework.[^1]

[^1]: It still feels clunky by today standards—can we have the `Codable` of data persistence already?
