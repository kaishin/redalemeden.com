Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order I’ve noted them down.

* The current chain of events unfolding across the US made me realize how much work still needs to be done in a country that prides itself on equality and justice. #BLM 

* _Tools for better thinking_ ([link](https://untools.co)). A nifty website with an assortment of techniques and frameworks to help with decision making and problem solving. The Dropbox Design blog [has more](https://dropbox.design/article/mental-models-for-designers) on some of these models.

* _Circle packing_ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing)). I was introduced to the concept of _packing density_ in business school as part of a product design and packaging workshop, but I never had the chance to take a look at the math behind it. Geometry is beautiful.

### Programming

* The UI on the [Crew Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_2#Crew_Dragon) was built using Web technology running on Chromium, according to this [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/gxb7j1/we_are_the_spacex_software_team_ask_us_anything/). 

* I’ve used Swift key paths here and there, but I never explored the lesser known parts of this API. This week I picked up `AnyKeyPath` and `PartialKeyPath<Root>` and used them for a server-side project I am working on ([link](https://klundberg.com/blog/swift-4-keypaths-and-you/)).

* Android phones seem to be crashing when using a particular image as a wallpaper ([link](https://www.androidauthority.com/image-wallpaper-crash-soft-brick-1124505/)). According to [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/mishaalrahman/status/1267940360967327746), the issue happens during color space conversion, where [the formula](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/master/packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/glwallpaper/ImageProcessHelper.java#47) used to create a pixel lightness matrix rounds the color values up, resulting in a RGB sum greater than 255.[^1] This in turn causes an out-of-bounds exception that keeps happening every time the system UI process restarts. 

[^1]: This formula is formally called sRGB Luma (Rec. 709). I’ve written more about it and other color lightness topics [here](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/closer-look-color-lightness).
