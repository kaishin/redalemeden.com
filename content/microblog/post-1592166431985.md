Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order I’ve noted them down.

* _Spontaneous cognition_ and how random thoughts emerge from the brain ([link](https://cognitiontoday.com/2020/06/spontaneous-cognition-mind-wandering-default-mode-network-daydreaming-random-thoughts/)).

* [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), a peer-to-peer protocol powering a number of decentralized Internet projects. I knew about [Solid](https://solidproject.org) and [Dat](https://dat.foundation), but never heard about this one, which seems to be even more popular within the decentralized Web community according to [this survey](https://medium.com/fluence-network/decentralized-web-developer-report-2020-5b41a8d86789).

* NGINX has now a preview release with HTTP/3 over QUIC support. The [announcement blog post](https://www.nginx.com/blog/introducing-technology-preview-nginx-support-for-quic-http-3/) has a good overview of the technology and how it’s different from its predecessors.

### Programming

* The `Fail` publisher in Swift Combine. Similar to its sibling `Just`, it competes immediately, but with a failure instead of a value—useful for testing and debugging the unhappy paths in your app ([link](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/#reference-fail)).

* Writing tests is vital for maintaining a healthy, and functional, codebase. This is less of a revelation and more of a reminder: a test I wrote while debugging a database query issue helped me discover and fix two unrelated bugs.
