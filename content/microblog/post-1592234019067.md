Nikita Prokopov sharing [his experience](https://tonsky.me/blog/syncthing/) using a free and open-source alternative to Dropbox called [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net).

> Syncthing is everything I used to love about computers. It’s amazing how great computer products can be when they don’t need to deal with corporate bullshit, don’t have to promote a brand or to sell its users. Frankly, I almost ceased to believe it’s still possible. But it is.

It is indeed heartwarming to see products like these still exist.[^1] I gave up on Dropbox long ago, and I have the same iCloud issues Nikita outlined. I am very happy to jump ship after reading this glowing review.

[^1]: Bonus points for being made in Sweden under a non-profit!
