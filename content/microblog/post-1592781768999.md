Here are some of the things I learned this week, when I wasn't biking or basking in the sun.

* Why books—and other traditional methods of knowledge transmission—don’t always work ([link](https://andymatuschak.org/books/))[^1]. It is no coincidence that this essay resonated with me a great deal—learning is a topic that’s very near and dear to my heart. Most of the skills I use today to do my job are self-taught, and learning languages was and is still a big passion of mine. Andy expands on the idea that without additional [metacognitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition) skills, reading books is insufficient to acquire knowledge and understanding due to the flawed *transmissionist* model that they are implicitly based on.[^2]
* Speaking of reading, I picked up the latest work of [Shūzō Oshimi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shūzō_Oshimi), <ruby>血<rt>ち</rt></ruby>の<ruby>轍<rt>わだち</rt></ruby> (chi-no-wadachi, Trail of Blood, 2017–ongoing), and I wasn’t disappointed. What starts out as a run-of-the-mill slice of life quickly spirals into an unsettling psychological thriller with some of the most nail-biting moments I've experienced in the format. If this sounds like something you would enjoy, give it a shot ([日本語](https://www.amazon.co.jp/血の轍-1-ビッグコミックス-押見-修造/dp/4091896235/), [English](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/616944/blood-on-the-tracks-volume-1-by-shuzo-oshimi/)).

He was kind, helpful, and profusely generous with insider knowledge that helped me improve some of the articles I wrote on [thoughtbot’s blog](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/authors/reda-lemeden). I stumbled across his website this week and I am really looking forward to more of his work in the field of learning and cognition.
