Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order I’ve noted them down.

* I am a bit late to the [r/covidcookery](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidcookery/) party, but this weekend I baked my first cake ever! An okay-looking, totally edible pound cake. There’s definitely a lot of room for improvement, but the sense of achievement when I took it out of the oven and it wasn’t a complete mess is quite the feeling. Thanks [Alaa](https://twitter.com/aldn00) for the hands-on tips!

* It took [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) 150 years after their discovery by Williams Rowan Hamilton to find practical uses such as 3D computer graphics and robotics. Immediate applicability is never the primary goal of mathematical research ([article](https://www.nature.com/articles/475166a) via Hacker News).

* [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) is a budding client-server protocol aiming to offer a bloat-free alternative to the HTTP Web. It uses a Markdown-inspired document format and completely forgoes client-side scripting and styling ([source](https://toffelblog.xyz/blog/gemini-overview/)).

* I saw a PC ad on Japanese TV that ended with the _Intel Inside_ slogan:「インテル入ってる」(_interu-haitteru_). Pretty clever for a marketing localization, right? Well, as it turns out, the perfectly-rhyming Japanese slogan came first (!) and served as inspiration for the English version, according to Susumu Furukawa, the president of Microsoft Japan between 1986 and 1992 ([source](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%86%E3%83%AB%E5%85%A5%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6%E3%82%8B)).

### Programming

* I totally missed this initially, but it’s possible starting iOS 14 to customize the navigation bar title in SwiftUI ([link](https://sarunw.com/posts/custom-navigation-bar-title-view-in-swiftui/)).
