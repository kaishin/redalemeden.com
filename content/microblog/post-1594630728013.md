Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order I’ve noted them down.

* Lambertian surfaces and their photometric properties, through [this stunning interactive guide](https://ciechanow.ski/lights-and-shadows/) by Bartosz Ciechanowski.[^1]

* I learnt quite a bit from [this exploratory piece](https://nshipster.com/as-we-may-code/) by Mattt about how core concepts from the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) can be used to make the code we write semantically richer, unlocking new authoring, distribution, and reuse possibilities in the process.

### Programming

* How the new `matchGeometryEffect` works in SwiftUI. This new API enables synchronizing view animations and transitions regardless of their place in the hierarchy. It’s quite powerful and will make some previously labor-intensive effects much easier to achieve ([link 1](https://iankeen.tech/2020/07/03/cross-view-animations-with-matchedgeometryeffect/), [link 2](https://swiftui-lab.com/matchedgeometryeffect-part1/)).

[^1]: If you had asked me ten years ago about how Wikipedia or Wolfram Alpha would look in 2020, I’d have pictured something along the lines of Bartosz work. Yet, we’re absolutely nowhere near that. One can't help but wonder if we have been focusing on the right things.
