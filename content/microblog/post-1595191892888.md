Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order I’ve noted them down.

* Understanding any topic in greater depth requires honesty, integrity, and patience. Thinking hard about the problem space and seeking first-hand experience also yields far deeper understanding than contenting oneself with the syntheses of others ([link](https://nabeelqu.co/understanding)).

* Beta invites to OpenAI’s [API](https://beta.openai.com), powered by the new GPT-3 ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf)), are starting to go out and some of the demos are generating a lot of buzz at the moment. [This was the article](https://maraoz.com/2020/07/18/openai-gpt3/) that brought my attention to this.

### Programming

* How to properly use [services](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/services/) in Vapor 4. I am still not fond of the amount of work involved, but it’s an effective way to extend the built-in capabilities of the default types.

* How to use `HTMLElement` to build a custom DOM element that encapsulates structure, styling, and interactions ([link](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html)).

* How the `isSource` and `properties` arguments in SwiftUI’s `matchedGeometryEffect` work ([link](https://swiftui-lab.com/matchedgeometryeffect-part2/)).
