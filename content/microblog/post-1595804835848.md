Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order I’ve noted them down.

* This week I picked up [aws-sdk-swift](https://github.com/swift-aws/aws-sdk-swift) in order to integrate with [SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), Amazon’s cloud email service. After some initial struggle figuring out which API version to use and how, I managed to send emails from a server-side Swift app I am currently working on.

* Some valuable lessons about S3, AWS billing, and CDNs by Chris Short ([link](https://chrisshort.net/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/)).

* SwiftUI’s new [`Menu`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/menu) component is now available on iOS 14 as of Beta 3. I suspect contextual menus to gain more traction on iOS and I am happy to see them join a growing list of SwiftUI components.
