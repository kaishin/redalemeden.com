I enjoyed Chris Krycho’s take [on the idea](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/this-week-i-learned/5/), but I totally understand [where he is coming from](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/this-week-i-learned/ending-for-now/). Like any other commitment, it takes time and energy that might not always be readily available. 

After four months of running this experiment, I am starting to feel the pressure. Some weeks go by where I don't learn much worth mentioning, or simply don't have enough time to elaborate. But I remain convinced this is a habit I'd like to keep—if anything, it helps me rebuild confidence in my ability to follow through commitments of this kind.
