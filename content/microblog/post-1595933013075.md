I enjoyed Chris Krycho’s take [on the idea](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/this-week-i-learned/5/), but I totally understand [where he is coming from](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/this-week-i-learned/ending-for-now/). Like any other commitment, it takes time and energy that might not always be readily available. I still hesitate to hit the “publish” button whenever I’m not completely happy with the content—which is most of the time, to be honest—but I somehow convinced myself that doing so is the only way to keep this going. I have failed more than one personal commitment in the last 3 or 4 years—for my morale alone, following through this time around is more than worth it.
