Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order I’ve noted them down.

* The \[coastline paradox](Coastline paradox - Wikipedia) refers to the phenomenon where the fractal nature of coastlines causes their length estimates to vary widely depending on the scale of the *ruler* used. This length tends towards infinity as the measurement unit gets smaller and smaller, going against the logical expectation when measuring a finite distance (via [Marc Edwards](https://twitter.com/marcedwards)).

* The [proportionality bias](http://www.skepdic.com/proportionalitybias.html) refers to our tendency to assume that major events have major causes. While it’s often [cited](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-some-people-believe-in-conspiracy-theories/) as a likely reason people believe in conspiracy theories, it’s also why programmers spend hours debugging a problem, probing every nook and cranny, only to find out that the cause is much more trivial than what was anticipated.

### Design

* In 3D graphics software, namely Blender, a *shadow catcher* is a completely transparent material that “catches” and renders the shadows of other objects in the scene—useful when exporting 3D renders for further 2D composition and editing. When using the *Cycles* renderer in Blender, this is as easy as ticking a checkbox. In EEVEE, Blender 2.8’s new rendering engine, it requires using a custom shader to obtain a similar effect.

### Programming

* I went trough the first half of the [Tour of Rust](https://tourofrust.com/57_en.html) guide with the intention of getting more familiar with its syntax and memory management APIs. Beside the relationship between *ownership* and *mutability*, many of the concepts introduced in what I’ve seen so far felt quite similar to their Swift counterparts.
