Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order Iâ€™ve noted them down.

* [Polybius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_(urban_legend)) is an urban legend from the early 2000s around an arcade game experiment that was allegedly run by the US government in Portland, Oregon in the 80s. According to the legend, the addictive game has disappeared without a trace shortly after its supposed release. Most of this sounds ludicrous, but was an entertaining read nonetheless.

### Design

* The [Zeigarnik Effect](https://lawsofux.com/zeigarnik-effect.html) refers to people's tendency to remember incomplete tasks better than successful ones (via [Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com)).

### Programming

* Writing both the client app and the API server in Swift has some pretty significant benefits. In addition to sharing a lot of business logic, this approach reduces the impact of context switching when developing a new end-to-end feature. Writing the same language, using the same IDE, in the same workspace is a godsend.
