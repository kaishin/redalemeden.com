Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order Iâ€™ve noted them down.

* [Esprit de l'escalier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27esprit_de_l%27escalier), "the staircase spirit", is a French expression used in English to describe the frequent occurrence of coming up with the perfect reply only after leaving the premises of the argument or debate.

### Programming 

* What _connection pooling_ means in the context of server-side applications and how it's implemented and used in various Swift frameworks ([link](https://forums.swift.org/t/generic-connection-pool/39161)).

* [Orthogonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality_%28programming%29) in programming refers to the ability to use a limited set of constructs in a limited number of combinations, where changing one part doesn't affect the others (via [this article](https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/)).

* Speaking or orthogonality, or extreme lack thereof, the Web front-end ecosystem is as fragmented, poorly documented, and messy as ever. With every new wave of build tools, frameworks, and dependency managers comes an additional layer of compatibility issues and gotchas. Sometimes writing few extra lines of code for one less dependency isn't all that bad.
