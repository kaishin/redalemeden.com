Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order I’ve noted them down.

### Programming

* How to use [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) and [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) to create interactive slide decks. It’s essentially a mashup of Markdown and React components that generates interactive, highly customizable HTML slides. This stack lends itself particularly well for the Web-development related material I am currently working on.

* I never paid close attention to how bitwise operations and bit shifting exactly work, but [this article](https://www.donnywals.com/understanding-swifts-optionset/) by Donny Wals prompted me to stop procrastinating and go over the official [Swift guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AdvancedOperators.html) on the topic.

* I managed to use the new `redacted(reason:)` modifier in SwiftUI and remove the custom view I used for the purpose of displaying placeholders while the content loads. Happy to see utility APIs like these make their way to the framework.
