Starting next week I will be helping [Hyper Island](https://www.hyperisland.com) students take their first step into the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I feel elated for getting this opportunity to share my passion for the Web, and I hope that by covering its basic building blocks I can provide them with a framework of how to think about its past, present, and future.
