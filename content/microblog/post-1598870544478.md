The new site design is live! ðŸŽ‰ This time around I focused on rethinking the landing page and expanding the light appearance to cover the entire site, not just the content area. For the light color palette, I drew some inspiration from [the earliest](/images/kaishinlab-2009.png) iterations of the site, circa 2009.

Other changes include a new [portfolio](/portfolio) page, pagination in the microblog, and moving _This Week I Learned_ to the main blog.
