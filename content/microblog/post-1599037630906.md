There is something about pull requests [like this](https://github.com/kaishin/redalemeden.com/pull/93) that leaves me with a warm, fuzzy feeling that's quite hard to capture in words. Knowing that there are people out there who care about details as much as you do and who actively seek to make whatever they come across better is truly motivating. Thanks [@dkhamsing](https://twitter.com/dkhamsing) for making my day!
