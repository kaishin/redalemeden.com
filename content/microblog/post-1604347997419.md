I worked on a single server-side API endpoint for four hours straight. It involved an OAuth dance with a third party service, a database read _then_ write, and some data validation along the way. I only compiled the code once at the end and fired a request against the new endpoint. Lo and behold, everything worked _exactly_ the way it should. 

I _love_ using Swift on the server.
