I found [a solution](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8242927?answerId=32883265022#32883265022) to the problem I posted about [a while ago](/microblog/post-1605383139658). It turns out that clearing input cache using these two commands takes care of restoring things to the way they're supposed to be:

```
sudo rm /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.IntlDataCache*
sudo rm /var/folders/*/*/*/com.apple.IntlDataCache*
```

Now back to typing Japanese. やったー!
