As you might have already heard, Apple announced earlier this summer their plans to turn off IDFA—a unique device ID used by advertisers track users across apps. Following the backlash from online advertisers and mobile game publishers that this move triggered, they subsequently [backed down](https://www.idropnews.com/news/apple-backs-down-on-ios-14-ad-privacy-after-backlash-from-facebook-and-game-developers/142386/) this fall when iOS 14 was released.

In the light of this development, Mozilla [put out a page](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/apples-anti-tracking-plans-iphone/) with a form for users like you and me to show support for Apple's anti-tracking plans. I signed it and I recommend anyone who cares about online privacy to do so[^1].

[^1]: The fact that both Apple and Mozilla generate a lot of revenue, albeit indirectly, from online and mobile advertising might sound puzzling at first, but the potential gains in terms of brand value and consumer trust would more than make up for it.
