As you might have already heard, Apple announced earlier this summer their plans to turn off IDFA—a unique device ID used by advertisers track users across apps. But they [backed down](https://www.idropnews.com/news/apple-backs-down-on-ios-14-ad-privacy-after-backlash-from-facebook-and-game-developers/142386/) following the backlash from online advertisers and freemium game developers.

Mozilla [put out a page](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/apples-anti-tracking-plans-iphone/) with a form for users like you and me to show support for Apple's anti-tracking plans. I signed it and I recommend everyone who cares about online privacy to do so[^1].

[^1]: No need to remind me that both Apple and Mozilla indirectly generate non-negligible revenue from online and mobile advertising.
