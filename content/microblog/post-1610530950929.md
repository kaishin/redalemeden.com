Between [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine)'s `Publisher`, [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture)'s `Effect`, and [NIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio)'s `EventLoopFuture`, I am often left wondering what operations are available where and what they're called. Maybe I can use some type aliases and extensions to bridge the API gaps.
