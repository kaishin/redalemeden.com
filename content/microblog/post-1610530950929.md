Between [Combine's](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) `Publisher`, [The Composable Architecture's](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) `Effect`, and [NIO's](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) `EventLoopFuture`, I am often left wondering what operations are available where and what they're called. Maybe I can use some type aliases and extensions to bridge the API gaps.
