In preparation of the beta launch of one of my yet-to-be-announced projects, I have spent some time devising a plan for server-side caching using Redis. This led me to read about some common caching strategies such as *cache-aside* and *write-through* ([link](https://hazelcast.com/blog/a-hitchhikers-guide-to-caching-patterns/)). I was never fluent in backend development jargon, but itâ€™s never late to fix that!
