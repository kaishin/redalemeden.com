Today I open-sourced [Kroma](https://github.com/kaishin/Kroma), a collection of color helpers for SwiftUI. While it's not feature-complete, it might be already useful in a handful of situations, such as determining if a given color is perceived as light or dark. This will likely end up being split into 2 packages down the line as I add more framework-agnostic color manipulation and conversion helpers. In the meantime, give it a try and let me know what you think!
