Yesterday I started migrating this site to the [freshly announced Gatsby 3.0](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/gatsby-v3), and to my delight, it was a much smoother experience than I had anticipated. I had some issues with [one particular community plugin](https://github.com/kaishin/redalemeden.com/commit/fd9510cd6ca67fd8dde16c5035d81b1147e530ff), but the fix didn't take long to surface on GitHub. The changes are living on the `gatsby-3` [branch](https://github.com/kaishin/redalemeden.com/tree/gatsby-3) for now, but that shouldn't remain the case once I am done migrating to [the new](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/image-migration-guide/) `gatsby-plugin-image`.
