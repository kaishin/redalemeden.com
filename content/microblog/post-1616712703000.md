Sylvain Kerkour [writes](https://kerkour.com/blog/the-biggest-threat-to-rust-sustainability/) about the high churn rate in the Rust language:

> Unfortunately, there is *one* thing that makes me anxious about its future: the 6-week development cycles. It’s, I believe, one of the causes of an unhealthy problem: feature bloat. It’s also the cause, in my opinion, of another problem: the immaturity of the ecosystem.

I share some of these feelings with regards to Swift. On the flip side, seeing a language grow and evolve right before your eyes can be a unique educational experience. I genuinely can’t wait for the concurrency work to land and make all my code obsolete overnight.
