With the Gatsby 3.0 migration complete, I took some time to try out [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com). The onboarding was smooth and the build times were almost twice as fast as what I saw on Netlify for the same build. I moved this site there already and will follow up with the others in the coming weeks.
