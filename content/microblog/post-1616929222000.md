I love the indie Web concept of [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE), but it's not universally practical given how the platform and the format actively shape the content. Many of my micro-posts fit poorly in the context of Twitter/Mastodon, which prompted me to come up with ~~creative~~ hacky [workarounds](https://github.com/kaishin/redalemeden.com/commit/809b5d55f52b2b1a6ea33c96c37868031b7fe761) to remedy thatâ€”entirely defeating the purpose of POSSE. Going forward, all content posted here will be syndicated to a dedicated account, [@WideGamutFeed](https://twitter.com/WideGamutFeed), leaving me the freedom to retweet or quote tweet using the main account for additional context or commentary.
