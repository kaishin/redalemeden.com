"No one gives a shit what programming language you use." A harsh but forthright [rant](https://georgestocker.com/2021/03/28/no-one-gives-a-shit-what-programming-language-you-use/) by George Stocker.

There's nothing wrong with preferring one language over another, as long as it is not the only deciding factor. I was tempted to use Swift for building static sites, but I decided against that because JavaScript and its ecosystem, warts and all, is still better suited for Web development.
