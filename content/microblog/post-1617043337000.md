I noticed that I consistently, and mistakenly, name the first closure parameter in Swift functions with multiple trailing closures. My 2 cents on [SE-297](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0279-multiple-trailing-closures.md) now that the dust is settled: ignoring that feedback was not a programmer-centric decision.
