This easter break I built my first command line utility in Swift using the [Argument Parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) library. My main motivation was to automate some of the tasks I have been doing manually in one of unannounced projects. The result is a kickass CLI with all the bells and whistles such as help, auto-completion, etc. Shoutouts to [Nate Cook](https://twitter.com/nnnnnnnn) over at Apple for this awesome library!
