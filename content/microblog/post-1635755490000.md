This weekend I hesitantly started migrating my 11k <abbr title="Line of Code">LOC</abbr>
server-side Swift project to use `async`/`await`, and I've been having a blast.
I still have ways to go, but the code is easier to read and reason about, which conveniently
casts the light on areas that can be refactored out to streamline the codebase even further.
