Starting iOS 10 and macOS 10.12, *Foundation* supports units and measurements out of the box, in the form of [(NS)Unit][unit] and [(NS)Measurement][measurement] respectively.

To get started, let's define a measurement. To do that, you have to pass a  *value* and a *unit* to the initializer:

```swift
import Foundation

let snorlaxWeight = Measurement(value: 460, unit: UnitMass.kilograms)
// -> 460.0 kg
```

You can then effortlessly convert the measurement to another unit:

```swift
let snorlaxWightInImperial = snorlaxWeight.converted(to: .pounds)
// -> 1014.12723328454 lb
```

You can also define your own unit by extending one of the default [*dimensions*][dimensions] available:

```swift
extension UnitMass {
  static let snorlax = UnitMass(symbol: "snorlax", converter: UnitConverterLinear(coefficient: 460))
}
```

The converter is used to transform the measurement from any given unit to the base unit of the dimension; Kilograms in the case of `UnitMass`. You can inspect the base unit of any dimension by calling `baseUnit()` on it.

```swift
UnitMass.baseUnit()
// -> kg
```

Once defined, your custom unit can be used alongside the pre-defined ones:

```swift
let statueOfLibertyMass = Measurement(value: 225_000, unit: UnitMass.kilograms)
let statueOfLibertyMassInSnorlax = statueOfLibertyMass.converted(to: .snorlax)
// -> 489.130434782609 snorlax
```

You can also define a custom dimension of units by subclassing `Dimension` if necessary. Here is an example that defines a new `UnitDataRate` class for measuring data transfer rates, often used in Internet speed tests:

```swift
class UnitDataRate: Dimension {
  static let kilobitPerSecond = UnitDataRate(symbol: "kbps", converter: UnitConverterLinear(coefficient: 1))
  static let megabitPerSecond = UnitDataRate(symbol: "Mbps", converter: UnitConverterLinear(coefficient: 1_000))
  static let gigabitPerSecond = UnitDataRate(symbol: "Gbps", converter: UnitConverterLinear(coefficient: 1_000_000))

  override class func baseUnit() -> UnitDataRate {
    return .megabitPerSecond
  }
}

let speed = Measurement(value: 100, unit: UnitDataRate.megabitPerSecond)
let speedInKpbs = speed.converted(to: .kilobitPerSecond)

// -> 100000 kbps
```
