*[Assumed Audience](https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/assumed-audiences.html) --- People who have been following my work and/or are interested in independent blogging.*

Between a new job, a house move, and a flurry of depressing news, my productivity took a hit in 2016. I was nevertheless able to do some fun things on the side:

- Built and launched [Speedster], a native bandwidth speed testing app for macOS. The feedback was very positive, but I [struggled with the business model][Speedster retrospective]. As of this writing, the app is no longer available on the App Store, while version 3.0 is still in the works (more on that later).

- Launched then open-sourced [Markoff], a lightweight Markdown previewer app for macOS.

- Published [three][views] [more][custom button] [articles][subclassing views] in the *Designing for iOS* series that I started back in 2015.

- [Customized an arcade stick][stick] ðŸ•¹ and had a ton of fun doing it.

- Designed a macOS [replacement icon] for [Undertale].

- Released [ImageScout 1.0], a Swift implementation of `fastimage`.

- Made a [visualization] on Swift 3.0 Access control.

- Gave [a talk] about Swift API guidelines at CocoaHeads Stockholm.

- Released [Gifu] 2.0 after 3 months of testing. The new version is written in Swift 3.0 and introduces a new protocol-based API that makes the library a lot more versatile.

- Removed all analytics from my websites.

- Rewrote Speedster in Swift 3.0 and dropped the dependency on the [SpeedOfMe] API.

- Resumed recording [Tentative] and the [1st episode] of the season is already out!
