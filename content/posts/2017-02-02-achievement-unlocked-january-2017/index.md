Amidst all the depressing stuff going on, it is sometimes healthy to celebrate the little victories of everyday life. Here is a round-up to follow up on [the one][Retro 2015] I wrote a little over a year ago.

### 2016 Retrospective

Between a new job, a house move, and a flurry of depressing news, my productivity took a hit in 2016. I was nevertheless able to do some fun things on the side:

- Built and launched [Speedster], a native bandwidth speed testing app for macOS. The feedback was very positive, but I [struggled with the business model][Speedster retrospective]. As of now, the app is no longer available on the App Store, and version 3.0 is in the works (more on that later).

- Launched then open-sourced [Markoff], a lightweight Markdown previewer app for macOS.

- Published [three][views] [more][custom button] [articles][subclassing views] in the *Designing for iOS* series that I started back in 2015.

- [Customized an arcade stick][stick] 🕹 and had a ton of fun doing it.

- Designed a macOS [replacement icon] for [Undertale].

- Released [ImageScout 1.0], a Swift implementation of `fastimage`.

- Made a [visualization] on Swift 3.0 Access control.

- Gave [a talk] about Swift API guidelines at CocoaHeads Stockholm.

### January 2017

#### Code

Even though I've been writing less code outside of my full-time job, I managed to do a complete rewrite of [Speedster] 3.0 since last September. The app is now written in Swift 3.0 and no longer relies on the [SpeedOfMe] API for the tests (good riddance). A good chunk of my time off last month went into revisiting the UI and hunting down a couple of timeout issues that I'd like to fix before pushing the first beta.

On the open-source front, I managed to release [Gifu] 2.0 after 3 months of testing. The new version is written in Swift 3.0 and introduces a new protocol-based API that makes the library a lot more versatile.

Last but not least I managed to remove all analytics from my websites. Yay privacy!

#### Design

I took a little break from code and spent some time refreshing the Speedster icon. I swapped the color palette and added some extra details to the needle as you can see on the [Dribbble shot].

#### Podcasting

We resumed recording [Tentative] and the [1st episode] of the season is already out! We discussed our new year's resolutions in a quite spontaneous and laid back episode.

#### Writing

A little over ten years ago, I started a *manga* (Japanese comic) side project. I have been sporadically revisiting it since, adding tiny bits to the story and characters.
As time went by however, I started losing the spark that initially got me going.

Last month, I discarded all but the name of the main protagonist the overall tone of the story. A new direction that will hopefully get the creative juices flowing and help me keep the momentum.

Creative writing aside, I'd like to push these updates more frequently to stay motivated and keep everyone interested in my side projects in the loop.
