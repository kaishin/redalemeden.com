### Programming

- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com) is now in [maintenance mode](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/). I have used it on several occasions in the past, without realizing that it has fallen out of favor in today's ecosystem. I looked for an alternative to display relative dates on the [microblog](/microblog) page and settled up on the more lightweight [date-fns](https://date-fns.org).

- This week I have been grappling with an annoying SwiftUI bug that only affects the simulator. The stack trace isnâ€™t of much help and no amount of view hierarchy tweaks got rid of it entirely. Initially I was under the impression that either my code or one of my external dependencies were doing something horribly wrong, but [this post](https://steipete.com/posts/state-of-swiftui/) from Peter Steinberger made me realize that it is rather widespread. For now, I am commenting out the code branch that triggers the issue when building on the simulator.

- I refreshed my knowledge on variable fonts in CSS and the considerations to make when working with them thanks to this wonderful [guest lecture](https://gist.github.com/ubuwaits/81bd4945c94ab905333a5ce686daca11) by [Chad Mazzola](https://chad.is). Hope my students enjoyed it as much as I did!
