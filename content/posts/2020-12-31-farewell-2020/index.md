As challenging and anomalous as this year has been, I sought to make the best out of the exceptional circumstances. In March I quit my full time job to focus on a handful of personal projects—a [conference](https://swiftandfika.com/), a book, and a digital product. While the first was indefinitely postponed due to the pandemic, being confined at home was perfect for the remaining two—but more on that hopefully soon. In early fall, I had the opportunity to teach Web front-end development at [Hyper Island](https://www.hyperisland.com/programs-and-courses/frontend-developer); a unique and rewarding experience that I’m not ready to forget any time soon.

Another perk of being stuck at home is having the opportunity to try new things. I learned how to make rather average pound cakes and play some rudimentary music on synth. I also played a good dose of competitive Pokémon and Street Fighter V, with the occasional single player game to keep things fresh.

On the minus side, I have spent far less time with family and friends than any previous year. But my hope is to rectify that next year.

Farewell, 2020. Hello, 2021.
