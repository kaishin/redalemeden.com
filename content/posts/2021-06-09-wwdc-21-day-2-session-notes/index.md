WWDC is finally here! Since I won't manage to post daily takes this year, I thought I'd jot down the sessions I watched along with a key takeaway for each. The sessions below are listed in the order I have watched them:

- [What‚Äôs New in SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10192): I'm really excited about the new modifiers for list, which felt a bit abandoned last year. I hope later betas introduce some APIs to read the content offset of `ScrollView`; I need this frequently and I am not happy with the current workarounds.

- [What‚Äôs new in Foundation](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10109): The new attributed string and formatter APIs are simply brilliant. Kudos.

- [Add rich graphics to your SwiftUI app](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10021): While I sort of expected the addition of  `Material`, `Canvas` caught me off-guard and I am loving it. üòç

- [Meet DocC Documentation in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10166): Hands-down my favorite new surprise announcement this year. Lots of neat little details‚Äîsuch as autocomplete symbol links for cross-referencing‚Äîand the project is slated to go open-source later this year! üí™

- [What's new in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10192): Really loved this session, especially the shoutouts to various efforts from Swift community members.

- [Meet async/await in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10132): Great starting point to get familiar with async/await and what they bring to the table.

- [Meet StoreKit 2](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10114): I have no idea why I picked up this session, but I don't regret it! Great to see async/await being already used in the SDK this prominently.
