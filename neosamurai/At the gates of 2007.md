# At the gates of 2007

*SATURDAY, DECEMBER 30, 2006*

If you check my archives, you will notice that Neo Samurai started in may 2006. Truth is that I have deleted, deliberately, all the previous entries. My blog has been around for over 1 year and half, and even though it is much different from what it used to be in the beginning, it is still the same web address, the same Kaishin, the same Japan… I still remember very well the entry that I had written in the 29th of December 2005, and here I am writing an entry, that won’t be much different from the former.

I am still standing in the middle of nowhere, or maybe my advancement is unnoticeable compared to the grandness of the desert. With nothing but the sun to locate my path, I kept walking for days, that added up to weeks, that added up to months, only to find myself kneeling down and contemplating the horizon ahead of me. Will I find the oasis head? or is it just a mirage that’ll dissipate as soon as I’ll get there? I am sweating, thirsty, afraid of the unknown, with no one to lend a hand in the huge wilderness. I can’t go back, for I’ll die of thirst before reaching my starting point. The footsteps I left behind were buried under the sand dunes, leaving me with no choice but to advance forward. The blue sky stretches above my head, as if to witness my journey, and to monitor its outcome. Following the sun might be my only way out, but yet glaring at it with no filters might prove fatal to my sight.

I stand up again, determined to go till the end of the path I have chosen…the path of the sun. Even though I ignore what is to come ahead, I am ready to stand firm and deal with it, may it be my downfall or my glory. This is my journey afterall , the choice is all mine, and so would be the yields.

Kaishin, the lost Samurai

I’d like to thank all of you who are reading this entry, namely my friends (“S”,”G”, “Y”, “R”,”M”…), fellow netizens who drop by Neo Samurai every now and then (Mirai and Clayton came to mind first) , relatives who gave me tremendous support (Unc’), Ai-san who is assisting my admission procedure, Nintendo for coming up with the DS , and last but not least, JAPAN, for giving me a reason to live!

Happy new year everyone!
明けましておめでとうございます
