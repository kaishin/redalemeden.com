I have received an email from a blog directory stating that Neo Samurai looked
all scrambled on Internet Explorer. Only god knows how frustrated I was when I
have viewed Neo Samurai on IE!! I haven’t used IE for ages, and I have almost
forgotten that such a browser exists!! But I understand that there are many
people still using it, and every web designer is henceforth prompted to take
consideration of all browsers properties when making his site’s layout. But I
just hate IE, and don’t want to work on!! However I’ll try to adjust the frames
width, the size of the links in the sidebar and other details! Please mind using
[FIREFOX](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172521/http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/)
or [OPERA](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172521/http://www.opera.com/) ,
they are much better for viewing websites in general, and my blog in particular!
