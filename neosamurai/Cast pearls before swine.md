If you ever wandered what this proverb gives in Japanese, then now’s the time to learn one of my favorite Kotowaza, and if you already knew about it, then feel free to skip what follows ^^!
In Japanese, it is 猫に小判　 [NEKO NI KOBAN](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/5623/06.wav)  (click the link to listen), literally “(Give) coins to a cat”. Meaning don’t offer something to someone who is incapable of using it properly. Obviously, a cat won’t understand what coins are made for, in normal conditions that is, who knows…!!!
Actually “ [koban](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://image.space.rakuten.co.jp/lg01/21/0000136021/62/imgaa839445chvk3g.jpeg) “ is a former Japanese oval gold coin that was used in the Edo period. And since  [Pokemon Diamond and Pearl](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.pokemon.co.jp/game/ds/dp/index.html)  were released two days ago in Japan (yes, yes, I am a Pokemon games Otaku) I couldn’t come up with a better image than the famous mischievous cat Pokemon,  [Meowth](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meowth) , or Nyasu in the original version. The coin on his forehead is actually a /Koban/.

There is a closer equivalent to “cast pearls before swine”, and that is 豚に真珠　 [BUTA NI SHINJU](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/5623/07.wav) , “(Give) a pearl to a pig”, however since I like cats more than pigs, I ‘d rather use the first!

And one last thing, I guess since koban aren’t used anymore, maybe people will start using
猫に札 NEKO NI SATSU, “(Give) bills to a cat”, like a 5000 yen bil as shown in the picture…
