# Edo Soccer!

SUNDAY, JUNE 25, 2006

Today I had two stories to write about, the first is art-related , and the second is soccer related.
Bringing the two topics together was almost impossible, and “almost” means that there is always a chance! Luckily enough, I stumbled upon a piece of art that’ll bring all things together:

 [This poster](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172131/http://www.picassomio.com/art/24884/en/)  was submitted by Tenmyouya Hisashi (天明屋尚) in an  [internatinal art context organized in germany for the Soccer Worldcup 2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172131/http://www.artfootball.de/en/artists/) .
The Boys in Blue , often referred to as the Grandsons of Samurai -in some “foreign countries”-, were utterly defeated by the Brazilian team in their last chance to prove that they worth much more than a defeat (1-3) against the Aussies and a draw with Croatia.

As for Tenmyouya Hisashi, he is one of the “hottest” Contemporary Japanese artists. Born in Tokyo in 1966, Living in Saitama as for now, he is a self-taught artist who blends to perfection different cultural elements in his works. Every single work is full of figurative and symbolic details originating of various modern and traditional cultures. Tenmyouya uses traditional Japanese drawing techniques, to depict a distorted image of Japan, through emphasizing on often stereotyped ideas of Gaijin . His works also convey the idea of universal-cultural-fusions through a heavy exposure to universal -and often American- cultural symbols.
What makes his art works even more mysterious, is their “sartcastic disharmony” . Hisahsi injects a dose of black satire that confuses the perplexed viewer’s mind.
