*Topic I*
This is the Geisha plate on my desk that gave me the idea to write about the topic yesterday! And for those who prefer a professional write up about the topic, from corporate media, here is an article I have spotted this morning from  [TimesOnline](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2325867,00.html)  . And to clear up the confusion of different apprenticeship levels, I went into the trouble to “google*®*” for the best English resource, and I stumbled upon this awesome Geisha website,  [Geisha Immortal](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.immortalgeisha.com/index.html) .  [Their FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.immortalgeisha.com/faq_geisha.php)  explains in details the characteristics and the differences between Geisha, Maiko and Geiko.

*Topic II*
Mozilla are running a campaign to promote Firefox in Japan. For this sake, they have created a cute fox mascot to represent the browser, a move that is expected in  [the land of the cute](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii) .  [On their website](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://spreadfirefox.jp/mascot/) , they are runing a context to decide the name of the critter. Being a Firefox fanatic I couldn’t help suggesting a name: フォクシー　(Foxy)! I hope my marketing instincts will be taken into consideration!

*Topic III*
 [Japan needs nationalism](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/25/AR2006082501176_pf.html) , but not on the expense of freedom of expression, or so goes the article on Washingtonpost online about the raise of Japanese nationalism.
Nationalism, Shinzo Abe, Yasukuni, Junichiro Koizumi…those are the prevailing keywords of today’s Japan political news. Leftists are panicking as Shinzo Abe, the favored successor to current PM Junichiro Koizumi has declared that he his willing to upgrade Defence Agency to full ministry, amend Japan’s education laws to boost patriotism in schools,boost Japan’s military presence overseas… (via  [The Hindu](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/003200609031551.htm) )
Personally, I feel like things are going the way they should, towards building a  [proud Japan](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.s-abe.or.jp/) , as written in the background of Abe’s website welcome page.
Anyway, you can’t expect a different stance from someone who reveres hawks, as me!
