 [Furusato](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172510/http://bariken.com/ram/Furusato.ram)  (故郷) is a famous old song in Japan. Furusato may mean home, homeland or my hometown, and this shows how much “one’s home” is endeared in Japanese traditional culture. This song was adopted in the closing ceremony of the  [Nagano Olympic games in 1998](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172510/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagano_Olympic_Games) .

*Here are the Japanese lyrics:*
兎追いし かの山
小鮒釣りし　かの川
夢は今も　めぐりて、
忘れがたき　故郷

如何に在ます　父母
恙なしや　友がき
雨に風に　つけても
思い出ずる　故郷

志を　はたして
いつの日にか　帰らん
山は青き　故郷
水は清き　故郷

*The romaji version:*

Usagi oishi kanoyama
Kobuna tsurishi kanokawa
Yumewa imamo megurite
Wasuregataki Furusato

Ikani imasu chichi-haha
Tsutsuganashiya tomogaki
Ameni kazeni tuketemo
Omoiizuru Furusato

Kokorozashiwo hatashite
Itsunohinika kaeran
Yamawa aoki Furusato
Mizuwa kiyoki Furusato

*English version (not a word-to-word translation):*

Sometimes I dream I’m on the Hill
Chasing the wild hare - freely at will
Catching small fish - as the Brook murmers by
Place of my birthright - for you I sigh

Father and Mother - once you taught me
That treasures of life - are all given free!
Friendship and hapiness - Sunshine and Rain
Your words come back to me time and again

Clear crystal brooklet - fresh Hills of Blue
Whisper across the Breeze - where are you?
when fortune smiles on me - then Furusato
I will return to you, I love you so!

Listen to an instrumental version of Furusato
This song reminded me of a series of essays I was writing about “Homeland”,a fictional furusato that I have been looking for since the day I realized that I had no such a place to think of when listening to this song. Having a hometown that one cherishs, a place treasuring one’s childhood memories, a land that one can call “home”, is one of the most moving and heartwarming feelings~

Furusato makes me feel nostalgious for a place I have never been to!!
