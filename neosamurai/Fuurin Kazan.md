 [Takeda Shingen](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115135/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeda_Shingen)  武田信玄 is my favorite feudal ruler (or  [Daimyo](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115135/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daimyo)  大名) , and it is not the first time that I use an illustration depicting him on my banner. To my delight, the new  [Taiga Dorama ](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115135/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiga_dorama) 大河ドラマ, NHK’s annual treat , a historical TV series of 49 episodes featuring usually the most talented actors and actresses, is about one of Takeda’s men, Yamamoto Kansuke, a lonely genius of strategy in the  [Sengoku Era](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115135/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengoku_era) , 16th century.

Kansuke works under Takeda Shingen and pursues his dream of unifying the whole country through aiding the warlord of Kai. At the same time, Kansuke supports Shingen’s concubine Yu from his selfless affection for the woman who hates but eventually loves the warlord who killed her father and family. With the aid of Kansuke’s strategies, Shingen expands his power northward, where he is destined to fight with Kenshin Uesugi, the warlord of Echigo. The drama portrays how those who fight for their dreams face their destinies in the turbulent age.


The /Dorama/’s title is /Fuurin Kazan/  [風林火山](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115135/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/taiga/) , written in four Kanji, referring respectively, to wind, forest, fire and mountain. It is a  [Yojijukugo](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115135/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/05/kotowaza-vol2.html)  meaning “Swift as wind, quiet as forest, fierce as fire, and immovable as a mountain.” and it was the motto of the /Takeda Shingen/, quoted from Sun-tzu. The sentence goes on as an action agenda for victory in war/battles, basically telling that the key to victory is to rightly judge the situation and take appropriate action at the right time.
