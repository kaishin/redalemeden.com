Geisha have been for ages one of the most distinctive aspects of Japanese traditional culture,as well as the most stereotyped by foreigners, beside sushi! Their international popularity has grown even more thanks to works such as Memoirs of a Geisha and their unexpected success, both the  [novel by Arthur Golden](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_Of_A_Geisha)  and the  [hollywood movie](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_of_a_Geisha_%28film%29)  (which I haven’t seen till this very moment, and will probably never do so, since it’s just another “glimpse over Japanese culture from an American standpoint”).
As Mirai has written on her  [blog today](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.xanga.com/mirai33/525231417/item.html) ,
Today, we can observe a dramatic decline in the number of Geisha. This is partly due to the decreasing demand. It may be possible that in several years it will be difficult to find any genuine Geisha in Japan. They would probably not be real traditional Geisha , but just pretend ones for tourists…

However, from a more omptimistic point of view, things are doing pretty well these days in the Geisha world. First the phenomenon of  [Internet Ads that boosted the number of Maiko in Kyoto](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/national/news/20060821p2a00m0et008000c.html) . The MSN-Mainichi article states that:
Since it has become difficult for teahouses to find apprentice geisha who are descendants of geisha or who have connections with the area, more stores are advertising for apprentices online. As of the end of March the number of apprentice geisha in Kyoto stood at 75, the highest in 10 years.

Not only that, but Geisha start now promoting their lifestyle through  [Blogging](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://hanaen.exblog.jp/) ! Of course, Geisha can blog too!　(もちろん、お芸者さんはブログも出来ますよ!).  [Ichi’s blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://ichi.dreamblog.jp/)  got more than 220,000 visitors since the day it was launched!

The picture above is the cover of the Autumn 2006 issue of  [Kateigaho International Edition.](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://int.kateigaho.com/) 
According the  [MSN-Mainichi](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/specials/news/20060901p2g00m0dm003000c.html) , the decision of putting a Maiko (or Geiko, I am confused^^) in the cover of the issue wasn’t an easy one.
“No matter how deeply our readers are happy for us to delve into Japanese culture within the pages of the magazine, our research has shown that stereotypical images of Japan on the cover are still what most non-Japanese want to see,” explains the editor-in-chief Takeshi Kudo.

However there is one thing I can’t understand: I decided to write about Geisha yesterday, and today I have noticed that  [Mirai](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.xanga.com/mirai33/525231417/item.html)  has chosen the same topic, so this made me want to write about it even more, however what shocked me , is the fact that Mari over at  [Watashi To Tokyo](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.typepad.com/t/trackback/5847670)  decided to write about the same topic… What is more,  [Japundit](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://japundit.com/archives/2006/09/02/3449/trackback/)  too! It may seem normal to some, since blogs have usually the same sources of info, but I guarantee that this one isn’t really a news, not to mention that I was writing about it before reading any of the aforementioned blogs…Is today a Geisha day or something in Japan?
