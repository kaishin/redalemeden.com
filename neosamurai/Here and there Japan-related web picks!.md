TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 2006

I guess it’s time for me to take a two days break from Shinwa, and write about various things that has caught my intention on the web these days.
On the spotlight this week is the end of Koizumi Junichiro’s chapter on the Japanese politics book, as Abe Shinzo was elected the president of the LDP (Liberal democratic Party) ruling party on the 20th September, and has become henceforth Japan’s new PM.  [We sure will miss Koizumi-san^^!](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.xanga.com/mirai33/531141176/item.html) 
I highly recommend treading this  [Sunday feature on Japan Times about Koizumi](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20060924x1.html) , his past achievements as well as his mistakes as a PM!

Today I came across an interesting  [Japanese artist,](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://webpages.charter.net/crrey/fujiko/)  via  [Watashi To Tokyo](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://smt.blogs.com/mari_diary/)  blog, who blend to perfection Japanese Edo scenary with contemporary as well as pre-modern American culture, particularly Disney cartoons and some other comics. The results are amazing!

Spidey and his secret affairs!

But there is one that particularly caught my attention, and might have a deeeper connotation than Just blending the two cultures…

This work is based on a Chinese artwork entitled “Chinese lions”, featuring Simba, the main character of Disney’s The Lion king, and Osamu Tezuka’s Leo, the main character of “Leo, the white lion” (Kimba in America). In case you have never heard of this controversy, here is what wikipedia has to say on the topic:
“In 1994, controversy arose over the possible connection of Disney’s animated feature The Lion King with Kimba the White Lion. Fans in Japan and the US called for the Disney company to acknowledge the use of characters and situations from the Japanese production in the Disney movie. The situation has remained a controversy due to the Disney Company’s statement that no one in the company had ever heard of Kimba until after The Lion King was released - in spite of the fact that people related to the production of The Lion King had referred to “Kimba” as the main character of The Lion King.”

However , I ignore whether Fujiko Isomura had an idea about this controversy or not. The only thing I am sure of is that Disney’s work is DEFINITELY based on “Leo, the white lion”…and I think  [those similiarities](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://members.jcom.home.ne.jp/y-asada/leo2.html)  go beyond the scope of coincidences, unless I am missing something! and [ here are ](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.kimbawlion.com/rant2.htm) more proofs!


Did you know about Web 2.0?? I personally didn’t till I  [wikied](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web2.0)  it today. Even though I am completely familiar with all its components, I have never had the chance to know about this 2004 coined appellation. I read by the same occasion, an article about Web 2.0 in Japan, on the magazine about “Design and making things”,  [Pingmag](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.pingmag.jp/2006/07/06/web-20-in-japan/) .

Talking about webmags, I recommend people who manifest a high sexual culture curiosity to download the latest issue (September 2006) of the free online monthly magazine  [“Japanzine”](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.seekjapan.jp/download) .
It has a complete write up about S&M; , Sex slang, and Prostitution in Japan, beside many other interesting topics.

Last but not least, I enjoy works of art, especially when they are depictibg Shinwa, and even more when they are made on a huge rice field!
