…is the title of the  [new movie](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://www.crisscross.com/jp/newsmaker/341)  starring the American-Japanese 20 years old Christina Morimoto, who will be taking the leading role of a Japanese-American -naturally- having to move for a semester to Japan as an exchange student. The movie focuses on her exposure to Japanese culture for the first time and the difficulties she will have to face dealing with the , so popular, “cultures clash”. 
I don’t know whether those who complain about “the cultures clash” think that Japan is too peculiar, that manners and customs are rather suffocating, or that it’s inconveniant to be unable to decipher Kanji… But I personally feel like things such as cultures clash and concepts of the like are a mere product of misunderstandings, stereotypes, ignorance and selfishness!
Christina Morimoto thinks that “Americans need to have a lot more respect for the Japanese culture,” which is pretty true if all Americans were like [ the reporter who says FUJAMA](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://www.japanprobe.com/?p=430) , and JAPPAN…Luckily “My Japan” isn’t as his!!
