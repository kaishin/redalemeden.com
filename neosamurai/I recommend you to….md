* - Watch this  [Samurai documentary](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519015302/http://www.veoh.com/videos/v2484053qRBbhKy)  uploaded by a do-gooder to  [Veoh.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519015302/http://www.veoh.com/) , a website that offers high def videos uploaded by other …ahem…copyright infringing…users! Unlike YouTube, Veoh allows you to download high quality videos to your computer and watch them whenever you feel like doing so. It manages your video casts , video torrents and local media . Veoh features as well a built-in video player that has a slick black UI. (thanks to  [alexpappas over at Japundit](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519015302/http://japundit.com/archives/2007/02/27/5140/)  for the link)

* - Check the Wonderfest 2007 coverages on Dannychoo’s website ( [Figures](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519015302/http://www.dannychoo.com/blog_entry/eng/765/WF+2007+Winter+-+Figures/) ,  [Mecha](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519015302/http://www.dannychoo.com/blog_entry/eng/767/WF+2007+Winter+-+Mecha/) ). And for a less exhaustive but more entertaining coverage head over to “ [An eternal thought in the mind of Gozilla](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519015302/http://patrickmacias.blogs.com/er/2007/02/world_war_wonde.html) “. Nevermind if you are still wondering what Wonderfest is!

* -Watch this sublime CM of a Fukuoka based watches company called 宝石時計 長野 (Houseki Tokei Nagano):

Can be roughly translated as:
“What takes a person one hour to do, will take only 30 minutes for two”
“What takes a person one month to do, will take only one day for 30 people”
“What humanity can’t achieve in thousands years, might be done in one day if everyone unites to achieve it…”
“…as long as they work in harmony, that is”
