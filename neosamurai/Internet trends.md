FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 08, 2006

I apologize for not being able to update my blog on a daily basis. Sometimes I just don’t feel like writing anything, say, I lack motivation to blog, and prefer to work my Kanji or draw some sketches. Being an internet denizen, I spend more than 60% of my freetime surfing. Every morning, before even getting my breakfast, I gloss over more than 20 Japan-related news websites and blogs. I am not the type to use the social networking services, even though I have an account on almost all of them, including the famous MySpace. Talking about Myspace, I was glad to see one of my most favorite musicians ever:  [Yoshiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshiki)  (the ex-drummer/pianist of the legendary Visual Kei band X-JAPAN, 一番好きなバンドだよ！now running a solo career in Los Angeles) , has an  [account on MySpace](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.myspace.com/yoshiki)  too!!
What prompted me to talk about internet usage, and SNS, is this informative article on Metropolis online magazine:  [In the Mix!](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/recent/feature.asp) 
The article is about the raising popularity of SNS in Japan, such as the famous Mixi and other more topic-focused social networking sites.
Just come to think of it, internet trends have drastically changed in the recent years, or more accurately, since 2005. Now I can’t imagine internet without  [Wikipedia](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) ,  [YouTube](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)  and  [Flickr](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.flickr.com/) . Not to mention the increasing number of blogs and podcasts… Only now, we can say that the world is a small village, really!
