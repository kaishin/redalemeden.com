I finally received my  [Xp-5560b/WT-SE](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://www.xp-pen.com/products/5560bwt.htm) …and that is not a gundam model!! The gap between my posts is getting more and more noticeable , partially because it takes me a considerable time to write Shinwa chronicles, thus I often prefer to drop a short entry on Japundit. Blogging isn’t just my cup of Sake, so to speak, and unless I write about mythology, history or news, I don’t have much to share about my daily routines.
Yesterday’s entry was one of the most popular stories in Japanese mythology and Orochi is a name that recurs in many occasions in pop-culture, mainly video games and manga. And just in case you haven’t heard about the latest Mitsuoka super car, it was named  [Orochi](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://www.mitsuoka-orochi.com/gallary.html) , and features a snake-like front design. Mitsuoka is a small Japanese automobile company which builds modern Japanese cars to resemble British vehicles of the 1950s and 1960s. It is primarily a coach-builder, taking production cars like the Nissan Micra and replacing the bodywork with its own custom designs, according to Wikipedia.
And just for the “Sake” of allowing anyone who checks my blog to know my musical tastes, I have embedded a weekly artist chart from  [Last.fm](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://www.last.fm/) ,it is located in the lower part of the sidebar!
Sake cost Orochi his life, but  [Akie Abe still don’t get the hang of it](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://japundit.com/archives/2006/10/21/3886/trackback/) !
