I mentioned in the  [previous post](https://web.archive.org/web/20070518232841/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/11/to-err-is-human.html)  the Kappa, and I guess this is the perfect opportunity to introduce you one of the most prominent Obake around. Obake お化け, also Obakemono, Bakemono, or Youkai, are ghosts, goblins and monsters in Japanese folklore. Kappa is an aquatic creature, that has a humanoid shape, with a monkey face, a predatory beak, a turtle shell and a frog limbs. Its scaly skin can have various colors, but tints of blue and green are the most common. The amphibian creature lives in rivers and adventures out when hungry. Kappa’s favorite meals are children, /shirikiodama/ (尻子玉) (an mythical energy ball in the anus) and cucumber. The creature features a water containig organ on the top of its head, surrounded by a bushy hair , and allowing the Kappa to stay alive while on land. It is said that if the water on the top of its head spills, the creature dies instantly. This is why some people bow to the Kappa so that it bows to them and unintentionally spills the survival water. Kappa are skilled in traditional medicine, and can communicate perfectly in Japanese.


Kappa are an intrinsic part of Japanese culture, and you may even stumble across a sign warning kids to stay away from the river to not end up in Kappa’s intestines. However none of the people who reported sighting a Kappa were able to take a picture of the creature. It is said that Kappa developed from an ancient Japanese practice of floating stillborn fetuses down rivers and streams. Another theory is that the kappa were invented to scare children away from rivers or rice paddies, using the swollen anus common in drowning victims as “proof” of having one’s /shirikodama/ stolen, according to Wikipedia’s entry.
And yes, Even Kappa get drifted by the water current!!
