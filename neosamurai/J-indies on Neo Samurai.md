Neo Samurai is taking new directions. It is true that mythology and history were the reason I created this blog, but it’d be rather plain if I keep just writing about these two. Thanks to Tokyo Dan, I decided to introduce some J-indies, or  [Doujin](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172037/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/10/jindies-anyone.html)  music for a change.
For the time being I am still hesitating about the way I will proceed. I thought of posting a weekly selection of 4 or 5 indie songs, with a short description of the artists concerned. But I had hard time deciding the best way to share those songs (direct download, flash playlist, quick time, a mini-podcast…). Anyways, as a start, I am going to compile the songs in one downloadable file, with external notes about the song titles , artists and links. And since I am more passionate about Rock/Metal/Visual-kei J-indies, the featured songs will likely be in these genres. For more folk, blues and jazz, I can’t stress enough that  [WHIT](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172037/http://www.whitokyo.info/WHIT.htm)  features some great artists ( [Plastic Soul band](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172037/http://www.plasticsoul.jp/info.htm)  came to my mind first, but there are many others worth listening to).
