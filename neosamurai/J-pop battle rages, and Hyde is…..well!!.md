Even though I am not really into the Japanese Pop scene, I stumble from time to
time upon an interesting story, such as [this
one](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/face/news/20060825p2g00m0dm011000c.html)
. Ai Otsuka and Koda Kumi seem to be leading a fierce battle to win the Nihon
Recordo Taisho, Japan’s most prestigious music award. Even though I am listening
to Koda Kumi right now, it was just as a whim… I prefer Ai Otsuka’s

by far.

Today while browsing the archives of [Mari’s Watashi to
tokyo](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://smt.blogs.com/mari_diary/)
, I came across a very funny, yet pretty old, [story about Hyde, Wikipedia and
the mischievous-yet-funny
Ni-channelers](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://www.typepad.com/t/trackback/4033827)
, the vocalist of the Japanese visual…I mean rock band L’arc~en~ciel. It is
rumored that Hyde (pronounced Haido) is very short. He is keeping his real
height as a personal secret, and has never revealed it to media. However some
2-channel folks has assaulted his wikipedia entry and scattered the rumored 156
cm height all over the article, and in a VERY FUNNY WAY!!! the article was
modified many times, to end up locked as all controversial entries! I went into
the trouble of checking the history of the page and got this wonderful
description of our beloved Hyde . I wanted to copy/paste [the whole
page](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyde&diff=4167033&oldid=4167031)
, but I respect Hyde’s “privacy”…and even though I like ラルク, I couldn’t help
mentioning this story ^^ You can clearly see the number of times 156 is
mentioned, and sometimes in a really weird and funny way, I’ll pick the best
ones:

_156hyde_(ひゃくごじゅうろくハイド)は日本の身長156cm5’2”ヴォーカリスト>>>
156Hyde (One hundred fifty six Hyde) is Japan’s 156cm (5’2”) height vocalist.身
長（実は156cm）、体重、生年月日等のプロフィールを完全に隠して…そして身長が56cmで
あることを公表した。>>> Height (truth is that it’s 156 cm) , Hyde’s body height,
and birth date are kept hidden in Hyde’s profile…Then he announced officially
that his body height is 156cm.さらにはドラム、アルトサックスなど多様な楽器を身長
156cmながら操ることができる。>>> Furthermore, even though he is 156 cm, he can
play various instruments including Drums, Alto Sax… 156年1月56日生まれ>>> he was
born in the year 156,month 1, 56th.身長は156cm。hyde(身長156cm)は小学生の頃か>>>
Height is 156cm. Hyde (body heaight 156cm)was since grade school… and here is
the different bands Hyde played for, according to ni-channelers…

- L’Arc〜en〜Ciel
- 156
- P’UNK～EN～CIEL
- HYDE
- 156センチ (centi)
- 難波ロケッツ
- 156cm
- 国道156号線 (national highway number 156)
- Gackt
- GASTUNK
- ニルヴァーナ (Nirvana^^)
- メタリカ (Metallica^^)
- 156センチメーター (centimeters)
- サッポロ一番塩ラーメン
- マリリン・マンソン (Marilyn Mansion)
- 百五十六 (one hundred fifty six)
- 山本五十六 (Yamamoto 56)
- 身長 (Body height)
- 1.56ｍ
- 1560ｍｍ
- ひゃくごじゅうろくはいど (156 cm haido)

The Joke is that the English Wikipedia still have this info hidden between
lines, to this very moment…

Well I guess Haido-san won’t be pleased to see this post, so to atone for this I
am going to remove the info from the English Wikipedia. By the way the current
French wiki says it’s 158cm, and the Japanese one gives a broad interval from
156cm to 160cm or so, and emphasises on the fact that Hyde has never announced
it officially!!

Special thanks to Mari for the original story!!!
