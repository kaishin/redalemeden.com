# Japanese mythology: Origins

SATURDAY, JUNE 03, 2006

I have finally decided to delve into the depths of Nihon Shinwa (日本神話), or more appropriately Japanese Mythology in English.
Often overlooked in favor of Feudal Japanese history, Japanese mythology is a fascinating, as well as exquisite facet of Japanese traditional culture and beliefs. Japanese folklore is a part of today’s mainstream culture, even though often unnoticed since it can’t be dissociated from the latter.
The origins of Shinwa ,as I will refer to it henceforth, are versatile enough to drive one confused. From Chinese influenced Buddhist beliefs, to Shintoist traditions, en passant by agricultural-based folklore beliefs, Nihon Shinwa deserves its rank among the richest and most complicated mythologies on earth.
The first recorded chronicle of Shinwa is the famous KOJIKI (古事記), translated literally as “Records of Ancient Matters”, that was complied in 712 AD by the order of Empress Gemmei. The Kojiki contains many mythological stories and chronicles, from the beginning of the world till the reign of Empress Gimmei. It is divided into three parts:
Kami Tsumaki 上巻（かみつまき）(lit. Upper volume)focusing of the creation of Japan and the various deities (In shinto Pantheon there counts more than 8000 Kami/Megami).
Naka Tsumaki 中巻（なかつまき）(lit. Middle volume)covering the period extending from the reign of Jimmu, the first empror of Japan, till the 15th empror Ojin .
Shimo Tsumaki 下巻（しもつまき）(lit. Lower volume)covering the 16th to 33rd Emperors.

Even though the kojiki is the most prominent source of Shinwa, it lacks many details and events, especially concerning the deeds of several emprors who were mentioned without any further insight into their lives.

For those who want to do some further readings,  [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172609/http://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/kj/index.htm)  is an online version of Basil Hall Chamberlain’s 1919 translation of Kojiki.
