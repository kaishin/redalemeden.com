Tokyo Dan ( [part I](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/10/jindies-anyone.html) ) has went so far as to release a Q2 show dedicated to Kaishin!! I highly appreciate this move, and would like anyone who is reading this entry to grab it from  [WHIT](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://www.whitokyo.info/WHIT.htm)  website direct download, if you don’t use iTunes. It seems like Tokyo Dan is promoting Jindies, and all those who would like to promote Jindies as well, which will do only good to the whole scene!

And since I am at it I’d like to share two tracks of digital rock, from a band called  [Kairaku Ongakudou ](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://7.pro.tok2.com/%7Enijiden/kaion/) (快楽音楽堂) , featuring some catchy Japanese traditional instruments as well as highpaced digital tunes! A great mix !
