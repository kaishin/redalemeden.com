# Jindies anyone?

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 26, 2006

I had a brief chatting session with Tokyo Dan, the man behind  [What’s Happening In Tokyo](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://www.whitokyo.info/WHIT.htm) , or WHIT, a great podcast featuring various indie bands and artists from Japan, that Dan takes the trouble, or pleasure, to track himself! Actually, I have been listening to the podcast since its early days, and I can say that it’s getting more and more elaborate.

Tokyo Dan coined the term Jindies to refer to Japanese independent music, and even if my claim can’t be verified, there is no doubt that he spread the word about it. In Japanese the concept of Doujin is used to refer to independent art and leisure activities. Doujin means “same person”, and refers to people who are sharing the “same” hobbies. Doujinshi, refers to magazines or comics published by fans for fans, and so does *Doujin Ongaku* convey when talking about music.

Jindies are flourishing more than ever now, thanks to internet, and more accurately, web 2.0 technologies. Blogs, podcasts and online shops have made things a whole lot easier to any aspiring artist who is not willing to sign any contracts whith whosoever.

I discovered Rock Jindies way before I started listening to WHIT, when I realized that most bands perform way better when they are Indies than when they become Major, i.e. not involved with any major recording label. WHIT came afterwards to confirm that there are indeed some GREAT artists underground, who hardly reache the ears of those enslaved by Sony music and Toshiba-Emi.

But what really got me into Doujin Ongaku, and prompted me to go “off-topic” on NeoSamurai, are those websites brimming with talented artists who offer their tunes for free to people who LOVE MUSIC! Websites such as the Japanese  [MF247 ](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://www.mf247.jp/view/index.php) and the international  [Podsafe Music Network](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://music.podshow.com/)  ,to name a couple, are becoming more and more popular,as they allow users to rate, comment, recommend, share and most importantly enjoy the free tunes. Artists and listeners aren’t the only winners,this also allowed podcasters to overcome the hassles of copyrights, and embellish their shows with various music genres.

It seems like I got carried away a little bit, but I do really appreciate Doujin Ongaku, or Jindies and I’d like anyone who really loves Japanese music to support those artists in a way or another! Look forward my next “off-topic”!!
