#website/neosamurai

Today I was intending to end my soccer related entries with an article about “Samurai Blue” ,as nicknamed the Japanese Soccer team. However my friend Mirai has written a nice and informative entry on her blog, “ [Japan diary of culture](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172131/http://www.xanga.com/mirai33/500826757/item.html) “ , about this topic!!

I am still under the spell of Kikunokai performance, and I am not on the verge of forgetting about it anytime soon! So here is a short historical overview of the band and its founder.

Hata Michiyo , born in Kyoto, studied Japanese traditional dance (日本舞踊 Nihon Buyou) under the assisstance of Onoe Kikunojo, the first real master of the Onoe school of dance, formerly founded by the prominent contemporary kabuki actor Onoe Kikugoro.
In 1972, Hata Michiyo founded the dance troupe  [Kikunokai](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172131/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/06/kikunokai.html)  that has been reaping culture and arts awards since.
In 1976, the Kikunokai received the Excellent Art Prize at the Cultural Festival sponsored by the Cultural Agency of Japan.
Being a a Shihan (Master) of Onoe, Hata-san has toured over 22 countries with her troupe, showcasing the charm and exquisiteness of Japanese folkloric dance. She gained a tremendous fame with her coregraphy in the movie “Dreams” by the illustrious producer Akira Kurosawa.
