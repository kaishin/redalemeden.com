After a week of stressful exams, I decided to go to the Kikunokai  [show in Casablanca](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172634/http://www.moroccotimes.com/news/article.asp?id=15379) at all costs! and I did!

[Kikunokai](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172634/http://www.kikunokai.co.jp/english.html) is a tranditional dance troupe created by Michiyo Hata in 1972. Hata-san studied dance for years under the assistance of Onoe Kikunojo I, who was the first master of the dance school Onoe, founded by the famed contemporary kabuki actor Onoe Kikugoro VI. Based on Japanese classical dance, the members of Kikunokai perform various dances and artistic performances, as chants, Taiko drums and musical comedies.
I really appreciated the show, and particularly the Taiko drums performance and Awa-odori!! They were JUST AMAZING!

I feel rather tired to write a full-fledged entry, but expect more stuff to come about this troupe and their performances in the near future!
