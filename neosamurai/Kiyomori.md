Last time when I posted this picture, I talked about Roborior. Actually I have deleted that entry now, since I have just realized that my sources weren’t reliable enough. I apologize for the misunderstanding!

This robot above is called  [Kiyomori](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172131/http://kiyomori.jp/main.html) , a samurai-robot made by Tmusk, as one of the first prototypes that walk in a way very similar to humans. I have watched the video in the official website, and indeed it seems really revolutionary, a kind of step closer to  [Gundam](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172131/http://smt.blogs.com/mari_diary/2005/05/did_you_go_to_s.html) !!!
I bet Tmusk are trying to blend the past and the future of Japan!
