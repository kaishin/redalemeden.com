/Kotowaza/ (諺,ことわざ) are Japanese proverbs and sayings. Unlike western proverbs, kotowaza can take many forms, such as /Inarawashi/ (言い習わし), or short sayings, which are the closest form to western proverbs, /Kanyouku/(慣用句) or idiomatic phrases that have inexplicit meanings hidden behind the literary ones, and the /Yojijukugo/ 四字熟語 or four-chracter idioms.
Japanese culture is abundant with /kotowaza/, and they are frequently used in daily life conversations, often shortened for the sake of simplicity.
Here are some examples of the aforementioned kotowaza categories:
