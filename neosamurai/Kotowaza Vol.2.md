# Kotowaza Vol.2

MONDAY, MAY 29, 2006

 [Last time](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172516/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/05/kotowaza-vol1.html)  I have mentioned the three types of Kotowaza, based on their grammatical and lexical constructions. Today I am going to dive into the magical realm of Yojijukugo.
Yojijukugo are commonly known in English as “four-character compounds”, “four-character idioms”, or “four-character idiomatic compounds”. The idiomatic meaning of the compound can’t be directly inferred from the separate meanings of every kanji in it. This said, it is wrong to believe that every Yojijukugo has an idiomatic meaning, as there exists thousands of non-idiomatic four-kanji compounds. Yojijukugo were adopted from classical Chinese literature, Buddhist literature and scriptures, old Japanese customs and proverbs, and historical and contemporary Japanese life and social experience.

Today’s treat:

* 相手次第 (あいて　しだい/Aite shidai)

Being up to the other party/Determining one’s attitude or response based on the character, attitude, or move(s) of the other party.

* 青田売買 (あおた　ばいばい/Aota baibai)

Dealing in unharvested rice crop/One shouldn’t go beyond the course of events, and plan based on yet uncertain facts.

* 悪事千里 (あくじ　せんり/Akuji senri)

Bad news travel fast/Ill news spread like wildfire.

* 悪木盗泉(あくぼく　とうせん/Akuboku tousen)

A virtuous person does not commit an act that offends his moral principles no matter how hard pressed he may be.
