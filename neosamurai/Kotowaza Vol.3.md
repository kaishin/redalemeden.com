Here is this week’s treat of Yojijukugo:


* 一病息災　（いちびょう　そくさい/Ichibyou Sokusai） 

One who nurses a (small) chronic ailment lives longer than someone who takes his good health for granted. I like this Yojijukugo, which implies that one has to care for his health and realize how lucky he/she is compared to those who suffer from various ailments.

* 一粒万倍　（いちりゅう　まんばい/Ichiryuu Manbai） 

A single seed can eventually produce a great harvest./Even the smallest beginning can generate a greatest profit.

* 一刻千金 （いっこく　せんきん/Ikkoku Senkin） 

Very valuable time/ Every moment is precious/ Time is money. 

* 一殺多生　（いっせつ　たしょう　・　いっさつ　たしょう / Issetsu Tashou . Issatsu Tashou）It is justifiable to kill one harmful person to save the lives of many. This is an interesting Yojijukugo. Those who are used to Anime and Manga might be accustomed to this concept.
