メリークリスマス!!!
This is what people say in Japan in this season. "Huh?!!Are Japanese Christians?" those of you who ignore Japanese culture more than I do may wonder. Well, the answer is no, it is just western influence. Actually Japan isn't alone. China, Korea, North Africa and other corners of the planet celebrate Xmas in their own way, even though they have no relationship whatsoever with Christianity. Blame/Thank globalization!

Anyways, me I am spending this season in front of my computer, in a chilly square room, browsing the web for interesting stories about how Xmas is celebrated in the land of the rising sun!
Talking about the rising sun, the Hinomaru suits quite well Santa colors, as you can see in the picture opposite. This  [Santacon](https://web.archive.org/web/20070518232853/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santarchy)  was held in Kyoto, according to [ 3yen news](https://web.archive.org/web/20070518232853/http://news.3yen.com/2006-12-23/todays-unintentional-santarchy-in-japan/) , along with crowds celebrating the 73rd birthday of Emperor Akihito. Others prefer to go solo with the Santa garb , so as to catch the attention of lens wandering Harajuku, as  [Masa](https://web.archive.org/web/20070518232853/http://masamania.com/modules/myalbum/viewcat.php?num=12&cid=12)  has reported on his website (beware, contains uncensored unethical materials).
As you might, or might not know, 2007 is the year of boar /(Inoshishi) ./ It is not just a coincidence that people flocked to an amusement park in Oita prefecture to photograph an albino wild boar called  ["Bu-chan"](https://web.archive.org/web/20070518232853/http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/national/news/20061223p2a00m0na031000c.html)  as they want to use photographs of the animal on New Year cards.
Further west, in Aichi prefecture, a shortage of snow has prompted ski resorts managers to use  [artificial snow](https://web.archive.org/web/20070518232853/http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/national/news/20061223p2a00m0na024000c.html)  to delight visitors with a white Christmas.
It is pretty hard to miss the typo in the title of this entry. But then let me tell you that it isn't a typo, it's a reference to the hottest items this Christmas in Japan, and elsewhere, : The Nintendo Wii. A game console that caused quite a stir worldwide, thanks to its wand-like remote controller, attractive design and extended games library ( A Virtual Console that allows gamers to download old hits in exchange for Wii points). Too bad I have to wait a little bit longer to get my hands on a Japanese Wii and start  [vlogging about it](https://web.archive.org/web/20070518232853/http://surrealu.blogspot.com/) !!

The song that you are listening to now, unless you made more than 6 minutes to read this entry, is a Christmas  [Otokei](https://web.archive.org/web/20070518232853/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dojin_music)  tune by a duo calling themselves  [Lavish](https://web.archive.org/web/20070518232853/http://lavish.sakura.ne.jp/) .
