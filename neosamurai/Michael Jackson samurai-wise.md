# Michael Jackson: samurai-wise
#website/neosamurai

SATURDAY, MAY 27, 2006

Yesterday (Friday 26th of May) the pop-music legend M.Jackson has landed in Japan for the MTV Japan “legend award” , that will take place today (Saturday 27th of May). This is his first public appearance since his acquittal last June on child molestation charges in the United States. His visit includes also an orphanage in Tokyo, and meetings with Asian business communities on Sunday.

*”I look forward to seeing old friends and saying hello to my huge fan base in Japan who, like my other fans around the world, have for so many years consistently shown their love and support to me and my family,”* said Jackson in a statment.

I shouldn’t have been writing about this story on Neo Samurai, but what prompted me to do so is this funny picture of Jackson in samurai garbs.

This photo was taken when I was one year old, i.e 1987, during Michael Jackson’s “BAD Tour” in Japan. I don’t know much about M.Jackson, and I have never been one of his fans, but I guess his deeds in the American and the world’s pop scene are praiseworthy. This said, I can’t affirm how cool -or uncool- he looks with this samurai suit on, but I can say that it looks too artificial!!
