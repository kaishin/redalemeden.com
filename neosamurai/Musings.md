“I don’t know how my story had started, nor how would it unfold, even less how would it end. Day after day, I feel like I don’t belong to this world, that I was born against the flow of time, in a wide Sahara desert where the horizon hides the truth lying far beyond the burning sand dunes.
I have been walking, bare-foot, hoping to find the oasis…Only to get tricked by the mirage over and over again…
“To where?” I uttered kneeling down on the blazing dunes.
My life has been this way since my very first cry, roaming aimlessly, with nothing in hand but a gourd of despair.
Having no landmarks to locate my weak body, my quest to find a destination was even more challenging. Until the day I realized that the sun shines from the very same spot, everyday, every dawn, breaking the chilling loneliness of the Sahara nights.
I couldn’t help but get bewitched by the transcendental rising sun . I firmly resolved to seek its rays, to bear hunger and thirst, and to keep on walking under the daylight guidance…
I spend the nights counting the stars, hoping for the sun to rise again, to lit my pathway, thinking that no matter how long the night may get, a new morning shall definitely come…
And thus goes on my story, seeking the sun, and panicking from getting blinded by its radiance!”
