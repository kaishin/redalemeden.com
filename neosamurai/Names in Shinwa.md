[Names in Shinwa](https://web.archive.org/web/20070502195140/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2007/01/names-in-shinwa.html)

As [ Clayton had requested](https://web.archive.org/web/20070502195140/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2007/01/yachihoko-nunakawa.html) , I’ll explain briefly some aspects of naming in Shinwa, since it is sometimes rather confusing even in Japanese texts, let alone romanization and interpretation in other languages.

Usually the names given to different deities are composed of several kanji, ranging from 3 to 7 or even more in some cases. Those aren’t names in the strict sense, but rather aliases given in specific occasions, referring to one or many attributes of the /Kami/ concerned, with each kanji representing a concept or an attribute. As an example, the complete name of /Amaterasu/ is *Amaterasu-oo-omi-kami*天照大御神, meaning the Honorable(御) Great (大) Shining (照) Heaven (天) Deity (神). It is to note that Kami (神) is almost all the time appended to the name of deities. Deities are baptized in the moment of their birth, based on their most striking features, like *Hinoyagi-Hayawo-no-kami* (火之夜藝速男神), “Fire-Burning-Swift-Male-Deity” , since he embodied fire. Sometime, deities change their names when a specific event occurs, whether by changing the kanji altogether, or just the readings of the previous characters, like Oonamuji 大国主, Master-of-the-great-land, who got a new alias when  [he received Susanowo’s bow](https://web.archive.org/web/20070502195140/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/12/shinwa-ohokuninushis-victory.html) , Ookuninushi (大国主) , which is just another reading of his previous alias. However after he defeated his brothers and married /Suseribime/, he got a completely new name, *Hachi-Sen-Hoko-Kami* (八千矛神), or “One-thousand-spear-Kami”.

In some cases, the long names of deities are shortened for the sake of simplification, as *Hinoyagi-Hayawo*cited above, Izanami’s son whose birth caused her demise, who was given the more common name of /Kagutsushi/迦具土, or *Hachi-Sen-Hoko-Kami*(formerly /Oonamuji/) who was called later/Yachihoko/ヤチホコ．Actually it is common to write the names of some well known deities in Katakana, as Izanami イザナミ and Izanagi　イザナギ.
Since there are two major sources of /shinwa/, the  [Nihongi](https://web.archive.org/web/20070502195140/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/06/nihonshoki.html)  and the  [Kojiki,](https://web.archive.org/web/20070502195140/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/06/japanese-mythology-origins.html)  there are often differences in names, which explains why some deities have several aliases. Sometimes the names are pronounced the same way in the two versions, but are written with different characters.

PS: For romanization, I am following the  [Hepburn romanization system](https://web.archive.org/web/20070502195140/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization) . I use hyphens in the names for the sole reason of making them easier to read, since a one block name would be illegible , something in the lines of “Hachisenhokonokami”. The hyphens are put where I judge appropriate to split, following no specific rule.
