THURSDAY, AUGUST 24, 2006

After trying different formulae for my blog, such us “News stories blog”, “Personal essays blog”, “Diary”, “Traditional culture blog”… I couldn’t come up with something that really satisfies me. Thus I settled on a “Freestyle blog” , rather than a themed one, since I don’t really have much free time to think about adequate stories related to a specific topic. Now that I am back home from my trips, I can spare some time to drop few lines about various topics, including news, insights, thoughts, and informative posts about Japan. I’d like also to share my web discoveries with everyone who visits my blog, like useful links for those interested in learning Japanese, interesting websites and blogs, etc… I might also write Japanese posts from time to time, a matter of practicing my writing skills!
それでは、じゃあまた！
