Here we go again, a full-fledged revamped look in less than 40 days! This time It was the transition to Blogger 2 that prompted me to work out this theme. But I bet this one would last much more than the previous ones.
The illustration in the top right of the banner is of Takeda Shingen, one of the most prominent Shoguns. Actually the [ first ever banner](https://web.archive.org/web/20070505011150/http://i36.photobucket.com/albums/e9/kurenai_kaishin/neosam/neo_samurai.gif)  I made for NS featured a sketch of Takeda, so it must have a kind of nostalgic flair. Blogger 2 has got some interesting features, but it seems like I can’t do without some hacks. It is way easier to customize the look, as long as you grasp the structure of the new html code, and tags (labels) have finally made it to Blogger. I have tried to round off the corners as well, but that’s the best I could come up with. If you have noticed, every time you hover over a link, you get a screenshot of the page linked to, and this will come in handy to know where the link will be taking you to. This script is provided by  [Snap](https://web.archive.org/web/20070505011150/http://www.snap.com/) (c’mon! I know you want to see what it gives! check it out!)

I’ll be adding up new functionalities as I get more accustomed to the new code. You can subscribe to the blog feed by clicking “Subscribe to:  [Posts (Atom)”](https://web.archive.org/web/20070505011150/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default)  at the bottom of the page. Posts are easier to navigate through, since the they added to “older posts” functionality an they enhanced the archives accessibility.
Besides, I’ll be finally able to post following the schedule I came up with, since I finished my mid-term exams.
