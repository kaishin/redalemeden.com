# Neo Samurai resolutions

*SUNDAY, JANUARY 07, 2007*

My first post in 2007! It took me a week to spare some time for blogging, due to the fact that I am having my mid-term exams. As for 2007 Neo Samurai resolutions, I have made up my mind to invest more time and effort in my blog. It’s not like it’ll reap me fame nor anything, but it’s a good way to make new acquaintances and speak up your ideas! (It seems like I do still have a blogging identity crisis >.<)

Furthermore, I am willing to make a schedule for my posts, in the form of thematic weekly columns . This way visitors will now beforehand what to expect from the entry. The themes will be as follow: Mythology, History, Indie music, Japanese culture for newbies, Funny tidbits, Japan around the web and a weekly entry about myself. This structure will help me find enough content to write about everyday, or at least once every two days. If any of the following topics may interest you, please check every now and then!
