こんにちは、
I have started from scratch with this new version of Neo Samurai , as many things have changed since the day I started blogging about my passion:Japan.
I am Kaishin (魁心), although it isn’t my real name, I identify myself to it more than Reda (レダ). Born in the 15th January 1986,Casablanca,Morocco, I am leading a rather dull undergraduate life, in a business school. Sleeping averagely 6hours/night, a restless brain that is always thinking, even while asleep! Keen on abstract matters, arts, philosophy, cultures, and more importantly anything Made in Japan!!! If I had to sum up my interests in one word, it’d be Japan, as a country. However experience taught me that Japan, as a field of interest, isn’t just one entity. Even though I am more interested in Japanese culture and legacy, I am eager to learn anything relating to Japan, her popular culture, her landscape, her prowess, and eventually her people.
I just had to delete all the old Neo Samurai entries. However there is a way to check them out via google. Just hit the Search button in NeoSamurai sidebar, without inputting any keyword, and you will be taken to a google results pages, from there click the "cached" link available under the page you want to check!!
I have just discovered this google feature and I don't really know for how long those pages will remain!

Dislike:

Mainstream ideologies

Like:

Beside internet surfing, reading and writing, I enjoy playing video games (RPGs, Ueda Fumito's games, Nintendo franchises...), listening to music (mainly Visual kei, though I tend to savour J-pop and OSTs) , watching Dorama (Japanese live-action TV series), few anime (mostly historical), drawing and paiting...
I am not really into sports, but I practice occasionally tennis and skateboard.
