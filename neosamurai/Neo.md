# Neo?
#website/neosamurai

“Neo”, is a prefix derived from greek for “new”, and is used everytime there is an urge to convey the freshness and newness of something of old that has been revived. I some kind of noticed that “neo” is being used in a unprecendented frequency, in many fields ranging from politics to arts… It is in the same time handy and worrisome. Refreshing, but lacking originality. And then, as humanity advances, what will come out next? Neo Neo? Ultra Neo?
Till then my blog will be called Neo Samurai!
