Nō(能), also romanized as Nou or Noh, is one of three main Japanese traditional performing arts, along with Kabuki and Bunraku. As the new season of Nō plays starts this month,  [Metropolis magazine](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/recent/feature.asp)  has put up an informative article about this art, its roots and its characteristics. (check the  [Wikipedia entry](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noh)  for additional facts). For the uninitiated, this more comprehensive [ glossary of Nou terms](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/noh/brazellgloss.html)  might be of a great help. The same website has got several famous  [Nou plays translated](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/noh/index.html)  as well, with the original Japanese transcript, viewable separately or on the same page using frames.
There exists another theatrical art form, often associated with Nou, called  [Kyogen](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyogen) . It comes as an intermission between noh acts, and is intending to make the audience laugh, hence it features short comical acts, spiced with satire and parody.  [This website](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://www2.ntj.jac.go.jp/unesco/noh/en/index.html)  has got the key elements to differenciate Noh and Kyogen, as well as some  [streamable videos](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://www2.ntj.jac.go.jp/unesco/noh/en/movie.html) .
