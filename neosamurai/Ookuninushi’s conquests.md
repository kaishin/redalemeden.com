# Ookuninushi’s conquests

*WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 24, 2007*

Before getting furious at me, I’d just let you know, dear reader, that it’s not me who keep switching interchangeably deities names as I please, and I do only follow what was written in the Kojiki… and yes, the alias *Yachihoko* was used for only few pages of the book, corresponding to the previous post. From now on I’ll call *Ookuninushi**(大国主)* by the name he had previously. Actually aliases aren’t the only confusing aspect of this Kami, but also his romantic conquests, and the numerous spouses he had throughout his life. We have seen previously that  [he first](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115225/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/11/shinwa-oonamujis-hardships.html)  aimed for *Yagami-hime**(八上比売),* when he traveled with his 80 brothers (八十神), then he  [tied the knot](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115225/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/12/shinwa-ohokuninushis-victory.html)  with one of Susanowo’s daughters, *Suseri-bime**(須勢理毘売)*, then he had  [a romantic encounter](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115225/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2007/01/yachihoko-nunakawa.html)  with *Nunakaha-hime**(沼河比売)*, and exchanged love poems with her. Actually after coming back to his beloved wife, /Suseri-bime/, he managed to tie the knot with another 11 spouses, giving birth to a deity with each of them, and this makes of him the Kami with the highest number of brides so far! It’d be quite a long entry if I go through each of them, so this  [genealogy tree](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115225/http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4712/1768/1600/394840/genealogy-deities10.gif)  would save me some time and effort.
