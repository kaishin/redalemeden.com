*SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 2007*

As you might, or might not know, I am a big fan of Japanese independent music scene, and about 75 % of all the music I listen to is from amateur and independent Japanese artists. In Japanese these artists are labeled Otokei 音系, and their music is referred to as Otokei Doujin or Doujin Ongaku 同人音楽.Needless to say that Otokei produce and publish their music by themselves, without any major label backing them up . In Japanese the concept of Doujin is used to refer to any independently published work, be it manga, music or a litterary work. Doujin means “same person”, and refers to people who are sharing the “same” hobbies. Doujinshi, refers to magazines or comics published by fans for fans, and so does Otokei Doujin convey when talking about music. Tokyo Dan, the man behind the “ [What’s happening in Tokyo](https://web.archive.org/web/20070518233056/http://www.whitokyo.info/WHIT.htm) “ Podcast coined the term Jindies as an English alternative.

I do listen to virtually all musical genres, but I have a penchant for metal , rock , intsrumentals and game music. Today I picked 5 songs by a2c, the co-founder of Mintjam, my favorite indie band ever. (Click play button below to display the playlist)

MintJam is a band that was formed by Setzer and a2c in April 2003. They started as an amateur band offering their sounds on the Japanese indie community  [Muzie](https://web.archive.org/web/20070518233056/http://www.muzie.co.jp/) , but they brushed up their style and performance when Kya joined later in the same year, to become a widely acknowledged indie band. Their activity grew more wide-ranging when TERRA and A. Koga joined the band in December 2004, although Koga left shortly after. In 2006, kya also left the band. The highly technical play style, as well as the elaborate melodies are the selling points of Mintjam. Even though their rearrangements are faithful to the original works, they feature often lengthy melodic guitar solos and more elaborate rythms. Two of their most acclaimed original songs are “Rival” and “A Rude Performance”, while the covers of “Theme of Arcueid” and “Romancing SaGa 3: Last Battle” are perhaps their most famous game music arrangements.
