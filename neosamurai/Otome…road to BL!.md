# Otome…road to BL!

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2006

Japanese culture sure is fascinating, and sometimes perplexing, for /gaikokujin/ so to speak, or more disparagingly, /gaijin/. But Japanese subcultures are sometimes even more baffling, in the way they are exquisitely rich, and sort of unique. I had a topic about female Otaku, but I have somehow deleted it, probably I realized it was kind of offending. However, this topic seems to be the focus of Japanese medias , when it comes to subcultures, after the Otaku world and Akiba fortress are no more… I mean no more a mystery to the masses, thanks to the popular TV Dorama “Densha Otoko” , the novel and the movie of the same title and internet boards and websites. Thanks to Japanprobe’s entry, I felt like it’s time to rewrite the entry about female Otaku since it’s the subculture keeping media busy as of late, when it comes to Otaku-ism.
As shown in the first video below, Otaku now is a science, with ramifications and subcategories. Cosplayers, Doujin, Anitaku (Anime otaku), and BL otaku. The last being the Boy’s Love genre, also called やおい /Yaoi/, or 男性同性愛 /Dansei Douseiai,/translated as boy’s homosexual love. Shounen-ai 少年愛 and Shotacon ショタコン are also considered subgenres of BL.
In Japan female readers of BL are called Fujoushi 腐女子, literally meaning “rotten girls”, which often gives a derogatory meaning to the word. However; like Otaku, the word isn’t an insult in an absolute way, it all depends on the context and situations. Fujoushi’s heaven isn’t Akiba, but rather Otome Road, where you can find the butler cafés, that cater to this niche of Otaku, like the way maid cafés do for the male counterparts. Butler cafés feature REAL handsom boys sometimes, but recently more and more cafés are hiring girls, that impersonate handsom boys, i.e. FAKE handsom boys, like Cafe B:Lily-Rose, featured on [ Japanprobe’s post](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.japanprobe.com/?p=506) .
Those girls are often Fujoushi themselves, each with “his” own fetishes.
In this TBS-TV progam,  [2時ピタッ!](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.tbs.co.jp/niji-pita/)  (Niji PITA!), the duo, the half-French-half-Japanese Isabelle and the half-Slovakian-half-Senegalese Béné, know in Japan as  [イザベルとベネ (](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.1242.com/surprise/img/photo_izabene.jpg) Izaberu to bene), or イザベネ (Izabene) delve into the realm of BL and Fujoushi, with a bit of sarcasm…
First they go track Fujoushi in Otome road, carrying heavy bags, often filled with /Doujinshi/ and other related stuff. One of the girls came all the way from Kyushu, just to get some BL goods, stating that she will spend 50,000 Yen (around USD 420) to grab her fravorite novels and magazines. They went to Animato, a store that has a large BL section, with thousands of Doujinshi, novels and magazines, and drama CDs…which are “gross” according to Béné!
In the second part they head to the famous butler cafés, and ask the FAKE handsom guys about their tastes, since they are Fujoushi themselves….
*PS:*Fujoushi are also disparagingly called in Japan Kifujin 既腐人 (previously-rotten-person for older Fujoushi), Ochoufujin 汚超腐人 (Super-rotten-person), and Maaboudoufu、 [麻婆豆腐](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapo_doufu) （go figure out why!!).
And just between brackets, there are Fudanshi 腐男子, who are boys who read Yaoi, as well as Yuri (female homosexual love)!
Even though Fujoushi is a little bit offending, most girls answered YES witha SMILE when asked “Fujoushi??”. Why deny something that we have chosen to be ourselves?
