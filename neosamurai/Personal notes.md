I have been quite busy this week, as my final exams are starting tomorrow, and I am going to travel to Canada the week after the next. As a result I have been blogging less exuberantly than before.
Japan will be playing Croatia in few minutes, even though I am not keen on soccer,I am willing to watch the match, just for the sake of seeing with my own eyes the reason why Zico must resign!!
I am not sure about the next time I’ll be posting on Neo Samurai again, so you better subscribe by inputting your e-mail adress (in the sidebar) so that you’ll save time and get notified if the weblog is updated.
Meanwhile have fun with  [this illusion](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172643/http://www.freewebtown.com/kurenai_kaishin/library/document/illusion.html)  I made following  [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172643/http://www.johnsadowski.com/color_illusion_tutorial.html)  tutorial.
(focus on the central dot for 30 seconds, then move the mouse cursor over the image without moving your eyes!! TADAN:It will look like it’s in color until you move your eyes.) 

UPDTAE: Japan 0-0 Croatia!! There is a wee bit of hope, a WEE BIT!!
