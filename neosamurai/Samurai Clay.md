It is pretty hard to come up with a fine topic everyday, especially if I don’t feel like writing about anything!
I spent the day in front of my desk, listening to Podcasts, practicing Kanjis and drawing. I highly recommend  [Japan Talk](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://japantalk.org/)  podcast for Japan-related news and stories, the topics are well chosen, and they feature nice podsafe music. Talking about podsafe music, I checked  [the website](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://music.podshow.com/)  this evening to see what Japanese artists have to offer, and I wasn’t disapointed at all.
I was browsing youtube when I came across this clay animated short movie entitled: Samurai Clay! enjoy!
