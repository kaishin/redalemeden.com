I have mentioned  [Cube Works](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519053555/http://www.cube-works.co.jp/works/index.html)  briefly in my  [pink entry](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519053555/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/12/pink-is-beautiful.html) , a Japanese company that makes various products, ranging from stuffed animals, to key chains and figurines. While browsing their website tonight, I came across an  [interesting collection](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519053555/http://www.cube-works.co.jp/works/index_sub.html?/works/historylnquiry/index.html)  of historical figures figurines… figure it out!

Each figurine measures about 10cm in height, and costs ￥504! I’d grab’em all if I had the chance!
