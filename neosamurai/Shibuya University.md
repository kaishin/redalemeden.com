# Shibuya University?

*TUESDAY, JANUARY 16, 2007*

I learnt through  [Trends in Japan](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115126/http://web-japan.org/trends/lifestyle/lif070109_01.html)  that an unconventional university has opened in the trendy district of Shibuya, meant to/provide just what is needed to instill the joy of learning in the modern youth/, or so they said. This school has no actual campus, as the whole district, with its cafés, bookstores, shops and other fashionable premises act as classrooms for the lectures provided by all kinds of people; even those who are not qualified to teach, including student themselves, store clerks, Manga artists… The goal of Shibuya university is not yielding recognized degrees but rather creating a symbiosis between the learning experience and the community life, for the ultimate aim of “creating Japan’s future from Shibuya”, in the words of its president Sakyo Yasuaki. It is to note that anyone , who deciphers Japanese of course, can participate free of charge.

Personally I think that such an experience is worthwhile for a change from the stiff Japanese educational system. It is true that Shibuya, as a community, has contributed in the enrichment of modern Japanese youth culture, but one shouldn’t take it for more than an extra-curricular learning opportunity… Any thoughts?
