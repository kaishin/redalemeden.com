After  [saving the white hare](https://web.archive.org/web/20070518232945/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/11/shinwa-white-hare-of-inaba.html) , *Oonamuji*, the younger of the eighty brothers, continued his path following the trails of his siblings. The white hare hurried to princess *Yagami* and gave her an account of /Oonamuji/’s deeds. Hearing the animal’s words, she rejected the other brothers upon their arrival, and vowed to marry the brave young man. Furious, the eighty brothers ran back to /Oonamuji/with an evil ploy to bring forth his demise. They invited him to razorback hunting in the mountain. The sneaky siblings ordered their young brother to wait at the bottom of the mountain for the beast, after having moused it out from the top. As planned, /Oonamuji/ stood at the base of a slope and waited. Meanwhile, his older brother were busy carving a huge boulder so as to look like a boar, then they torched it ablaze. They unleashed the huge rock down the slope and gazed from atop the mountain. The boulder was coming at an incredible speed, and the naive /Oonamuji/ couldn’t identify its shape clearly. He stood firmly, without even questioning the real intentions of his brothers. The blazing boulder scorched /Oonamuji/’s body, and made an end to his life.

Following these events, his mother mourned and ascended to the Plain of Heavens (/Takama-no-hara/). She implored Takami-Musubi to bring back her child. So the great deity did send /Kisagahi-hime/ and /Umugi-hime/ who used their divine powers to bring back /Oonamuji/.

His eighty brothers couldn’t stand seeing him coming back to life, so they decided to deceive him again. They invited him for a walk in the mountain after having set up a trap for him. They cut a tree horizontally , and fixed a wedge between the two halves. Led by his brothers, the naive Oonamuji was standing on the wedge, when they promptly removed it and trapped him in the tree. They tortured him to death. Hearing his groaning, his mother rushed to the forest and released him. She intervened once again to bring him back to life, and advised him to leave Inaba at once, in order to escape the evil deeds of his siblings. He headed towards /Ohayabiko(no-kami)/’s place, in the land of Ki (land of trees). His brothers followed him with their bows and arrows, but he swiftly disappeared. It was about time that /Oonamuji/understands that his brothers want him no good!

NOTE:
There are various spellings of /Oonamuji/include /O_h_onamuji/, /O_h_onamudi,/ /O_h_namuji/, and others.By historical reasons, /k/, /s/, /t/, and /h/ are sometimes confused with /g/, /z/, /d/, and /b/ respectively. For instance, various spellings of /O_h_onamudi/ also include /O_h_onamuti/ and /O_h_onamuchi/(wikipedia)
