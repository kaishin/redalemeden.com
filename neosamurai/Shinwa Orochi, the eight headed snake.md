After he was [ expelled from Takamanohara](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/10/shinwa-missing-sun.html) , *Susanowo* descended to earth, and headed to *Hii*(斐伊) river, in  [Izumo province*.](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/Japan_prov_map_izumo.PNG)  While strolling alongside the river, he spotted a chopstick drifting with the stream of water, and deduced that someone should be dwelling in the hills up ahead. He kept going until he met an old couple and a young charming girl. They were weeping uninterruptedly. Curious, Susanowo inquired about the reason of their mourning. The old man explained that every year, an eight* headed serpent called *Yamata-no-Orochi* (八岐の大蛇) comes an get one of his eight daughters, and it was almost time for the beast to come and claim the last daughter.

/“I had originally eight young girls as daughters. But the eight-forked serpent of Koshi* has come every year and devoured one, and it is now its time to come, wherefore we weep. Its eyes are like akakagachi, it has one body with eight heads and eight tails. Moreover on its body grows moss. Its length extends over eight valleys and eight hills, and if one look at its belly, it is all constantly bloody and inflamed”/, Said the old man,*Ashi-Nazuchi*.

Hearing this , Susanowo suggested to the old couple to marry their daughter, *Kushinada-hime*, if he defeats Orochi and safeguard her life . Knowing that he came from heaven, *Ashi-Nazuchi* and *Te-Nazuchi* couldn’t help but accept his deal. Susanowo asked them to build a fence around the house, and to make eight gates into that fence, in each a barrel of Sake will stand. He turned the young lady into a comb and hid her in his hair.

After a while , the eight-headed snake-dragon came to take Kushinada-hime. However, even the almighty Orochi couldn’t resist and went ahead drinking the Sake before him, each head fuddling from one barrel. After he imbibed, he fell asleep, giving the golden chance to Susanowo to wield the Totsuka-no-Tsurugi and cut Orochi’s heads one by one, as well as his tails. When he slashed the last tail, his sword hit another metallic object and made a strident sound. when he carefully cut the tail open , he found a sword called*Ame-no-Murakamo-no-Tsurugi** (天叢雲剣) that he handed afterwards to his sister Amaterasu.

*Sidenotes:*
*Izumo is in present day Shimane prefecture.
*Koshi is a district in the province of Echigo, today’s niigata prefecture.
*”Eight” in mythology texts means “numerous”, and not necessarily eight. The same thing can be said on the number of gods who gathered in front of the cave to bring out Amaterasu as some versions say 80, some 800 and some use the more correct term of “myriads”. But for the sake of simplicity it’ll be considered eight heads and tails.
*Later called Kusanagi.


*Moral:*
NEVER EVER drink Sake before picking a fight! (-_-)”
