After Izanagi  [bore the three children](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/09/shinwa-purification-of-izanagi.html) ,*Amaterasu*,*Susanowo*, and *Tsukiyomi,* he rejoiced and said: “I, begetting child after child, have at my final begetting gotten. three illustrious children.”. He then ordered *Amaterasu* to rule over *Takamanohara*, or the high plain of heaven ( in some translations *Amaterasu* was ordered to rule over the day), *Tsukiyomi* to rule over the night, and *Susanowo*to rule over the sea. The two former fulfilled their roles, but *Susanowo* did nothing but weep and lament. He sobbed till the rivers and seas dried up, and the green mountains withered and turned dim. *Izanagi*approached him and asked: “How is it that, instead of ruling the land with which I charged thee, thou dost wail and weep?”

“I wail because I wish to depart to my deceased mother’s land, to the Nether Distant Land “ *Susanowo* replied.

*Izanagi* ,angered , scolded his son: “If that be so, thou shall not dwell in this land” and expelled him.

There are different versions of what became of*Izanagi*after he accomplished his divine tasks. In the /Kojiki/it is said that he lived as a hermit at /Taga/ in /Afumi/, current  [Omi province](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/Japan_prov_map_omi.PNG) , whereas in the /Nihongi,/ it is believed that he reported back to the heaven deities about his accomplishements, and settled there forever.

*Susanowo*replied obediently: “If that be so, I will bid adieu to /Amaterasu/, and depart”. He thereupon ascended the heavens, where his Older sister dwells. His boisterous nature caused a turmoil in the seas, and drove the mountains groaning on his way up to the heaven. Hearing his approaching noise, she doubted his intent, and readied herself for the worse. She untied her hair and wove it into two threads, then adorned her head and wrists with 500 /Yasaka/ jewels. She carried two quivers on her back, one holding 1000 arrows, and the other 500 arrows, then wore an arm pad and brandished her bow, and firmly grasped the hilt of her sword, standing valiently like a fierce warrior. When*Susanowo* reached her, she said “Wherefore ascendest thou hither?”, her brother replied right away: “I have no evil intent. It is only that when our fathe spoke, deigning to enquire the cause of my wailing and weeping, I said ‘I wail because I wish to go to my deceased mother’s land’, and our father replied ‘’Thou shalt not dwell in this land,’ and deigned to expel me with a divine expulsion. It is therefore solely with the thought of taking leave of thee and departing, that I have ascended hither. I have no strange intentions.”

“If that be so, whereby shall I know the sincerity of thine intentions?” Enquired *Amaterasu*.
“Let each of us swear, and produce children. If the children which I produce are females, then it may be taken that I have an impure heart. But if the children are males, then it must be considered that my heart is pure.”

Thus, they stood on the opposite sides of the Tranquil River of Heaven, *Ameno-yasukaha*(milky way), then*Amaterasu* asked Susanowo to hand her his saber, *Totsuka-no-tsurugi*, and broke it into three fragments. She washed the three fragments in the *Ameno-manawi*, the true-well of heaven. After chewing them with a crunching noise, she spat them away, giving birth to three /Megami/ (female Kami) from her breath:
* *Takiribime* 多紀理毘売命, the “Torrent Mist Princess”
* *Ichikishima-hime* 市寸島比売命, “Princess of the Island of the Offing”
* *Takitsuhime* 多岐都比売命 “Lovely Island Princess”

Next came *Susanowo*’s turn. He asked his sister to hand him the 500 /Yasaka/ jewels that were twisted on her head and wrists. Then washed them in the true-well of Heaven, crunched them, and blew them away, giving birth to five Kami:

* From the jewels on the left bunch of her hair, *Masakatsu-akatsu-kachihayabi-ameno-oshiomimi*正勝吾勝勝速日天之忍穂耳命, “Truly Conquering Swift Heavenly Great Ears”
* From the jewels on the right bunch of her hair, *Amenohohi* 天之菩卑能命
* From the jewels of her head-dress, *Amashi-hikone* 天津日子根命 , “Prince Lord of Heaven”
* From the jewels on her left wrist*, Ikushihi-kone* 活津日子根命 “Prince Lord of Life”
* From the jewels of her right wrist*, Kuma-no-kusubi* 熊野久須毘命

Then, *Amaterasu* declared: “As for the seed of the five male Deities born last, their birth was from things of mine; so undoubtedly they are my children. As for the seed of the three female Deities born first, their birth was from a thing of thine; so doubtless they are thy children.”
