*NOTES:*
Even though notes should be added at the end of the entry, I thought that they must be more useful if brought up at the start. First, I’d like to clarify that my purpose of writing such entries is to provide a personal reference of Japanese mythology, and share it with anyone who is willing to delve into its depths. There are several English resources around the net about the topic, but none seem to be complete. This compelled me to do a compilation work to satisfy my own thirst of knowledge. Then I thought that while I am at it, why not make others who might be interested in the topic capitalize on my efforts. Thus I decided to write a kind of chronicles , with every bit of information I can find on the topic. It’s true that entries like this one may look heavy with long lists such as the ones below, but for the sake of sufficiency, I’d like to sacrifice accessibility.
* The resources are mainly Hall Chamberlain’s kojiki translation, the Japanese wikipedia and the English wikipedia occasionally.
* The hyphens in the deities’, places’ and people’s names ARE BY NO MEAN based on any grammatical nor lexical rule. Since there are no spaces in those names, I put the hyphens for the sole purpose of facilitating their reading.
* the “e” in Japanese names is read as “e” in “set”, so “Ihasuhime” is read “eeh-ha-su-hee-meh”, for further details  [check this](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.kanjistep.com/en/online/hiraganasteps/a.html) .
