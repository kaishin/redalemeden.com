 [Izanagi and Izanami](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/09/shinwa-creation-of-universe.html#links) , the last of the 7 /kami/ generations /( Kami-noyo-nana-yo/ 神世七代 ) were commanded by the Distiguishing Heaven Kami (*Koto-amatsu-gami*別天津神) to “make, consolidate, and give birth to this drifting land.” The two /kami/ were given a jewelled halberd called *Ama-no-nuboko* 天沼矛.

They stood on the bridge between heaven and earth, *Ame-no-ukihashi*天浮橋, translated as “Floating Bridge of Heaven” and churned the sea with the spear, as illustrated in this artwork. They stirred till the brine became thick and glutinous, then drew the *Ama-no-nuboko*from the brine, at that time, the droplets of brine that fell from the spear tip piled up and formed the first island, *Onogoro* (Onogoro-jima 淤能碁呂島).

They descended and made a home of the island, and built a pillar called*Ame-no-mihashira* 天御柱 and a palace called *Yahirodono*八尋殿 , literally the hall whose area is 8 arm’s length square. Izanami called Izanagi to meet at the pillar , standing on opposite sides, Izanagi said “How is your body being perfected?” (view the  [original quotes](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E7%94%A3%E3%81%BF)  from the  [Kojiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/06/japanese-mythology-origins.html)  in Japanese). Izanami replied “My body has matured, but there is one part that hasn’t”, then Izanagai said “My body matured too, but there is one part that has overgrown. Thereupon, let’s join the place that hasn’t matured in your body, and the part that has overgrown in mine to give birth”.

This was the first sexual intercourse in Shinwa, which resulted in the birth of *Hiruko* 蛭子. However their first child was a failure, and had no bones. Their second child was *Awashima*淡島, literally the pale island, and was as well a failure. They put the children into a boat made of reeds and set them adrift in a river, or sea in some other sources.

“The children to whom we have now given birth are not good. It will be best to announce this in Takama-no-hara , the high plain of heavens.” said the Izanagi and Izanami. They headed towards the Koto-amatsu-gami to question the cause of the failure of their offsprings. The heavenly deities replied “They were not good because the woman spoke first. Descend back again and amend your words.”. So did the two/kami/. Izanagi called Izanami to the pillar, and sai “”Ah! what a fair and lovely maiden!”. She answered immediately “Ah! what a fair and lovely youth!”. From this union were born the *Ouyashima*　大八洲 , or the land of the eight islands:
* *Awaji*/(shima)/ 淡路島
* *Iyo-no-futana*(no-shima)伊予之二名島 (later Shikoku)
* *Oki-no-mitsugo*(no-shima) 隠伎之三子島
* *Tsukushi*(no-shima) 筑紫島 (later Kyushu)
* *Iki*(no-shima) 伊伎島
* *Tsushima* 津島
* *Sado*/(no-shima)/佐度島
* *Oho-yamato-toyo-akitsu-shima* 大倭豊秋津島 (later Honshu)

Note that Okinawa, Hokkaidou and Chishima weren’t a part of Japan in shinwa.
