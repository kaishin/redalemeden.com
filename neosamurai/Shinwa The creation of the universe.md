I have written a brief introduction to Japanese mythology, in two previous posts, where I introduced the two main sources, the  [Kojiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/06/japanese-mythology-origins.html)  and  [Nihonshoki.](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/06/nihonshoki.html) 
Shinwa started way before Japan lands were created, with several deities that appeared at the time of the creation of the universe (天地開闢 Tenchikai Byaku）) on /Takama-no-hara/高天原 , translated as “The High Plain of Heaven”. The first three were called The Universe three /Kami/（造化の三神 /Zouka-no-sankami/) and are as follow:
* *Ameno-Minakanushi*/(no-kami)/天之御中主神, can be translated as Master-of-the-August-Centre-of-Heaven, referred to as the North star nowadays.
* *Takami-Musubi*/(no-kami)/高御産巣日神, means High-August-Producing-Kami.
* *Kami-Musubi*/(no-kami)/神産巣日神, means Divine-Producing-Wondrous-Deity.

The five deities cited above disappeared with the creation of heaven and earth. The two next Kami, *Umashi-ashikabi-hikoji* (no kami) 宇摩志阿斯訶備比古遅神 and *Ameno-tokotachi* (no kami) 天之常立神, meaning respectively Pleasant-Reed-Shoot-Prince-Elder and Heavenly-Eternally-Standing-Deity, were born from a jellyfish-like thing floating on the sea. The 5 kami cited above are called /Koto-amatsu-gami/別天津神 , “distinguishing heavenly kami” and were born alone, hiding their persons. After the /Koto-amatsu-gami,/comes the /Kami-noyo-nana-yo/ 神世七代 ,can be translated as “the seven Kami generations” and is comprised of 10 Kami and Megami, divided eventually into 7 generations, with the last 5 generations having always a kami and a Megami as follow:

* *Kunino-tokotachi* /(no-kami)/ 国之常立神, translated as “Earthly-Eternally-Standing-Deity”.
* *Toyokuninushi*/(no-kami)/ 豊雲野神, “Luxuriant-Integrating-Master”.
* *Uiji* /(no-kami)/ 宇比邇神,”Mud-Earth-Lord “・ *Suiji*/(no-kami)/須比智邇神,”Mud-Earth-Lady”.
* *Tsumegui*/(no-kami)/ 角杙神,”Germ-Integrating-Deity”・*Ikugui*/(no-kami)/ 活杙神,Life-Integrating-Deity”.
* *Ooto-noji*/(no-kami)/意富斗能地神, “Elder-of-the-Great-Place”・*Ooto-nobe*/(no-kami)/ 大斗乃弁神,”Elder-Lady-of-the-Great-Place”.
* *Omodaru*/(no-kami)/淤母陀琉神 ,”Perfect-Exterior”・ *Ayakashi-kone* /(no-kami)/阿夜訶志古泥神, “Oh-Awful-Lady”.
* *Izanagi*/(no-kami)/伊邪那岐神,” Male-who-invites”・ *Izanami*/(no-kami)/ 伊邪那美神, “Female-who-Invites”.

Note that the relationship between the 5 last generations Kami and Megami, is Older brother-Younger sister (Kyoudai 兄妹)　.
