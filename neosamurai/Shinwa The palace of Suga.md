When  [Izanagi defeated Yamata no Orochi](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/10/shinwa-orochi-eight-headed-snake.html) , he went about looking for a place to celebrate his marriage with /Kushinada-hime/. He ended in a land in  [Izumo province, ](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/Japan_prov_map_izumo.PNG) and said 「ここに来て、私の心はすがすがしい」 (/Koko Ni Kite, Watashino Kokoro Wa Sugasugashii/), which can be translated as “As I arrived here, my heart is refreshed”, and thus that place was called Suga , from the adjective he used すがすがしい (/Sugasugashii/) to describe his state of mind.
He then built a palace in Suga, now considered “Suga-Shrine” in Izumo. When the clouds rose up, he made the first poem in Japan. The 31 syllables poem is called a  [Tanka](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waka_%28poetry%29#Tanka)  . Tanka are an older form of Japanese poetry than Haiku. They are always made following this morae pattern 5-7-5-7-7 :

「八雲立つ　出雲八重垣　妻ごみに　八重垣作る　その八重垣を」
(*Yakumo-tatsu*/Izumo Yaegaki/*Tsumagome-ni*/Yaegaki-tsukuru/*sono Yaegaki-wo*)

Susanowo’s Tanka can be translated as:

“Many clouds arise.
The manifold fence of the forth-issuing clouds
Makes a manifold fence
For the spouses to be within.
Oh! that manifold fence.”

After this Susanowo and Kushinada-hime had intercourse together and a child was born named *Ohona-muchi (no Kami)*. Then Susanowo designated *Ashinazuchi* and *Tenazuchi* as masters of that palace and bestowed upon them the title Inada no Miya-nushi no Kami.
