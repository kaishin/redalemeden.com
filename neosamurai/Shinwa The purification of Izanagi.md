*Izanagi* fled *Yomi*, leaving behind the goddess of Hades, his sister *Izanami*. Yomi, the land of Hades, is viewed in Shinwa, as in many mythologies, a dirty place. Thus Izanagi thought of purifying himself after getting out of it, “Nay! hideous! I have come to a hideous and polluted land, So I will perform the purification of my person.”

He then headed to *Awakihara* 阿波岐原, the “valley of  [Japanese clovers](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_clover) “ and cleansed himself in a river. As in the previous events, Kami are often born from every action of Izanami and Izanagi, and this is what makes Shinwa a mythology of over 8000 gods. This time, it’s Izanagi’s undress that gave birth to 12 deities, each associated with an item or garb Izanagi took off.

* From his staff, *Tsukitatsu-funato*/(no-kami)/衝立船戸神, a clear translation can’t be done, meaning loosely “Thrust-stand-come-no-further”.
* From his  [Obi](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_%28sash%29) , *Michino-nagachiha*/(no-kami)/ 道之長乳歯神, “Road-Long-Space”
* From his bag, *Tokiha-kashi*/(no-kami)/時量師神, “Loosen-Put”
* From his clothes, *Wazurahi-noushi*/(no-kami)/ 和豆良比能宇斯能神, “Master-of-Trouble”
* From his  [Hakama](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakama) , *Michimata*/(no-kami)/ 道俣神,”Road-Fork-Deity”
* From his crown, *Akigu-hinoushi*/(no-kami)/ 飽咋之宇斯能神, “Master-of-the-Open-Mouth”
* From his left hand bracelet:
  * *Oki-zakaru*/(no-kami)/奥疎神, “Shore-Distant”
  * *Okutsu-nagisabiko*/(no-kami)/ 奥津那芸佐毘古神, “Wash-Prince-of-the-Shore”
  * *Okitsuka-hibera*/(no-kami)/奥津甲斐弁羅神,”Intermediate-Direction-of-the-Shore”
* From his right hand bracelet:
  * *Hezakaru*/(no-kami)/辺疎神, “Offing-Distant”
  * *Hetsunagi-sabiko*/(no-kami)/ 辺津那芸佐毘古神, “Wash-Prince-of-the-Offing”
  * *Hetsuka-hibera*/(no-kami)/辺津甲斐弁羅神, “Intermediate-Direction-of-the-Offing”

Izanagi plunged in the middle , thinking that the water in the upper steam is too rapid, and the water in the lower steam is too sulky. Two Kami were born from the filth that Izanagi washed in the river, Yasoma-gatsuhi (no-kami) 八十禍津日神 and Ohoma-gatsuhi (no-kami) 大禍津日神, respectively the Wondrous-Deity-of-Eighty-Evils, and next the Wondrous-Deity-of-Great-Evils. And in order to cleanse the evil caused by these two Kami, three other Kami were born:

* *Kamu-naobi*/(no-kami)/ 神直毘神,”Divine-Rectifying-Wondrous”
* *Oho-naobi*/(no-kami)/ 大直毘神,”Great-Rectifying-Wondrous”
* *Izunome* 伊豆能売, “ Female-Deity-Idzu”

Next, on every level of water, a handful of Kami were born. As Izanagi bathed in the bottom water, two deities were born:

* *Sokotsu-watatsumi*/(no-kami)/ 底津綿津見神,”Possessor-of-the-Ocean-Bottom”
* *Sokotsu-tsunowo*/(no-kami)/底筒之男神,”Elder-Male-of-the-Bottom”

When he bathd in the middle of water:
* *Nakatsu-watatsumi*/(no-kami)/中津綿津見神,”Possessor-of-the-Ocean-Middle”
* *Nakatsu-tsunowo*/(no-kami)/中筒之男神,”Elder-Male-of-the-Middle”

When he bathed on the surface of water:
* *Uhatsu-watatsumi*/(no-kami)/上津綿津見神Possessor-of-the-Ocean-Surface
* *Uhatsu-tsunowo*/(no-kami)/上筒之男神Elder-Male-of-the-Surface

When Izanagi washed is left eye, the Megami *Amaterasu-ohomi (kami)*天照大御神(“Heaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity”), was born. When his washed his right eye, the kami *Tsukiyomi-no-mikoto*月読命 (“Moon-Night Possessor”) was born. And finally, *Takehaya-susanowo-nomikoto* 建速須佐之男命 (“Brave-Swift-impetuous-Male-Augustness”) was born when Izanagi washed his nose.

Those three last deities, commonly known as *Amaterasu* , the incarnation of the sun,
*Tsukiyomi* , the incarnation of the moon and *Susanowo* ,the incarnation of wind or storm, are the most important, and will be the focus of the next Shinwa entry.
