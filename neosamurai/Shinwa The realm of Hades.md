*Ameno-wo-habari*天之尾羽張 (also *Itsuno-wo-habari*都之尾羽張)… so was called Izanagi’s blood-stained saber*1, after  [he cut down his son Kagutsushi](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/09/shinwa-slaying-of-kagutsushi.html) , who was the responsible of Izanami’s, his mother, death . Izanagi bemoaned his younger sister’s demise, and decided to head towards *Yomi* 黄泉の国 (Yomi-no-kuni), or the land of Hades, to bring back Izanami. Yomi is believed to be the land where the dead are sent, rotting there forever. Unlike *Takamanohara*, the high heaven plain, Yomi in an underground realm that has a geographical connection with earth.
Once at Yomi’s entrance, believed to be in present day [ Izumo Province](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/Japan_prov_map_izumo.PNG) , Izanagi met Izanami, even though he couldn’t see but his sister’s blurry silhouette from outside, due to the pitch darkness of Yomi. Izanagi told Izanami, who came out from the depths of the dirty land to meet him:

“My lovely younger sister! the lands that I and thou made are not yet finished making; so come back!”

“Lamentable indeed that thou earnest not sooner! I have eaten of the furnace of Hades*2. Nevertheless, as I reverence the entry here of my lovely elder brother, I wish to return with thee to the land of the living. Moreover I will discuss it particularly with the Yomutsu-kami 黄泉神, the deities of Hades. Look not at me!” Replied Izanami.
Izanami headed back towards the palace of the Yomitsu-kami to consult with them about leaving Yomi, insisting that Izanagi should by no mean take a glimpse at her. Truth is that Izanami was afraid of shocking her brother, when he’ll discover her repugnant form. Izanagi grew worried about his sister tardiness. Impatient, he torched the outermost tooth of the comb stuck in the left side of his long hair, and headed towards the abysses of Yomi to find Izanami. On his way, he witnessed the repugnance of the underworld. His appall was overwhelming when he caught up with Izanami and looked at her outrageously horrid and rotten body, with umpteen maggots swarming all over. From every rotten part of the body, dwelt a kami:
* In her head, *Ohoi-kazuchi*大雷, the “Great thunder”
* In her breasts , *Honoi-kazuchi* 火雷, the “Fire thunder”
* In her belly, *Kuroi-kazuchi* 黒雷, the “Black thunder”
* In her genitalia, *Sakii-kazuchi* 折雷, the “Chance thunder”
* In her left hand, *Wakai-kazuchi*若雷, the “Young thunder”
* In her right hand,*Tsuchii-kazuchi* 土雷, the “Land thunder”
* In her left leg, *Narii-kazuchi*鳴雷, the “Rumbling thunder”
* In her right leg, *Fushii-kazuchi* 伏雷, the “Couchant thunder”

Scared, Izanagi fled back. Izanami, angry at him for disobeying her, said “Thou hast put me to shame”, then ordered *Yomotsushi-kome* 黄泉醜女, the “Ugly-female-of-Hades” to chase after him. Izanagi tossed away his headgear , and made it transform into grapes, in an attempt to delay Yomotsushi-kome. He kept running while she were picking them and enjoying their taste, a taste that she is unlikely to come across in Yomi. However she promptly caught up with him. He took off the outermost tooth of his right comb and made into turn into bamboo-sprouts, then fled on while she was devouring them. Izanami noticed that Yomotsushi-kome wasn’t a match to Izanagi, so she sent the eight thunder deities, along with 1500 warriors of Hades to catch him. He drew his saber the *Totsuka-no-tsurugi* and ran brandishing it at his back. When he reached the hills of *Yomotsu-hirasaka* 黄泉比良坂 , or the “Even Pass of Hades”, he took three peaches off the tree, and hurled them at the rushing hordes. Scared of his might, they fled back to where they came from. Izanagi uttered to thank the peaches that saved his life: “Like as ye have helped me, so must ye help all living people when they shall fall into troublous circumstances and be harassed!”, and then called them *Ohoka-muzumi-nomikoto* 意富加牟豆美命, the “Great-Divine-Fruit”. desperate, Izanami decided to pursue him herself. Izanagi rushed to the base of the slope that leads to Yomi, /Yomotsu-hirasaka ,/and blocked the pass with a huge boulder, called *Chibiki-no-iwa* 千引の岩. Each standing on one side of the boulder,Izanami said: “My lovely elder brother, If thou do like this, I will in one day strangle to death a thousand of the folks of thy land.” Then Izanagi replied: “My lovely younger sister, If /thou/ do this, /I/ will in one day set up a thousand and five hundred parturition-houses. In this manner each day a thousand people would surely be born.” From his event and on, Izanagi was called *Yomotsu-ohokami* 黄泉津大神, the “Great-deaity-of-Hades”. The rock blocking the path was called *Chikaheshi-no-ohokami* 道返之大神, the “Great-Deity-of-the-Road-Turning-back” and the pass is called *Ifuya* (伊賦夜坂 Ifuyazaka).


*1: Usually called Totsuka-no-tsurugi
*2: Those who taste the underground’s food, can never come out of it
