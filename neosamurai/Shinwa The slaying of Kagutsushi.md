 [After the birth of Kagutsushi,](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/09/shinwa-birth-of-gods.html)  Izanami suffered a lot and died from the pain. Izanagi kneeled down and wept at her legs: “Oh that I should have exchanged thee for this single child!”. From his tears was born *Nakisawame* (no-kami) 泣沢女神,”Crying-Weeping-Female”. Then Izanagi buried her in *Mount Hiba* 比婆の山 (Hiba-no-yama, current  [Shimane prefecture](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://ja.wikipedia.org/upload/a/ad/Shimane-pref_Small.png) ). Being unable to control his anger, Izanagai drew his sword, *Totsuka-no-tsurugi**十拳剣*, a sword measuring 10 “grasps”, each grasp being the width of four fingers when Izanagi’s hand is clenched, and cut Kagutsushi. The droplets of blood that dripped from the point of the Totsuka gave birth to three deities:
* *Iwasaku* (no-kami) 石折神, “Rock-Splitter”
* *Nesaku* (no-kami) 根折神, “Root-Splitter”
* *Ihatsu-tsunowo* (no-kami) 石筒之男神, “Rock-Possessing-Male”

Then from the blood that stuck on the upper part of the sabre three other deities were born:
* *Mika-hayabi* (no-kami) 甕速日神,”Awfully-Swift-Deity”
* *Hi-hayabi*(no-kami) 樋速日神,”Fire-Swift-Deity”
* *Takemi-kazushinowo* (no-kami) 建御雷之男神,”Brave-Awful-Possessing-Male”, who is also called /Take-futsu (no-kami)/ 建布都神 or /Toyo-futsu (no-kami)/ 豊布都神.

Two other deities were born from the blood that dripped from the hilt on Izanagi’s fingers,
*Kurao-kami*/(no-kami)/闇淤加美神 *Kura-mitsuha*/(no-kami)/闇御津羽神. From Kagutsushi’s body parts were born eight deities:
* From the head: *Masaka-yamatsumi* (no-kami) 正鹿山津見神, “Possessor-of-the-True-Pass-Mountains”
* From the chest: *Odo-yamatsumi*(no-kami) 淤縢山津見神, “Possessor-of-Descent-Mountains”
* From the belly: *Oku-yamatsumi*(no-kami) 奥山津見神, “Possessor-of-the-Innermost-Mountains”
* From the genitalia: *Kura-yamatsumi*(no-kami) 闇山津見神, “Possessor-of-the-dark-Mountains”
* From the left hand: *Shigi-yamatsumi* (no-kami) 志藝山津見神, “ossessor-of-the-Densely-Wooded-Mountain”
* From the right hand: *Ha-yamatsumi*(no-kami) 羽山津見神, “Possessor-of-the-Outlying-Mountains”
* From the left leg: *Hara-yamatsumi* (no-kami) 原山津見神, “Possessor-of-the-Moorland-Mountains”
* From the right leg: *To-yamatsumi*(no-kami) 戸山津見神, “Possessor-of-the-Outer-Mountains”
