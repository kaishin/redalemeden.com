After having wedded to princess *Kushinada* and bore several children, *Susanowo* headed to Yomi, as he planned since he was expelled to earth.
Time has elapsed, and generations has succeeded. Nothing notable happened until a valiant descendant of /Susanowo/ and his myriads of older brothers decided to go on a long trip seeking princess *Yagami*. *Oonamuji* 大国主 and his eighty older brothers left Izumo towards *Inaba*, where the beautiful princess dwells. Being the youngest, he was overpowered by his brothers, and thus was forced to carry their luggage during the journey. /Oonamuji/ grew tired and straggled behind his brothers. When he reached /Cape Keta/, he found a badly wounded white hare. The creature’s fur was pulled out, and the bruises on its naked skin were directly exposed to the burning sun rays. /Oonamuji/ drew nearer to peruse the hare and enquire about its outcome, “Why liest thou weeping?”. The worn out creature explained that he was in the island of Oki (not too far from /Izumo/ and /Inaba/) and had no way to cross the sea to reach the mainland, so he thought of a deceitful scheme. He called out one shark (crocodile of the sea as in Hall Chamberlain’s translation) and challenged him that the hares community is larger than the sharks one. The white hare asked the shark to summon all his friends so that HE can count them to prove the supremacy of his own community. Tempted , the shark called out all his companions, and swam on the surface alongside eachother. The hare jumped on their backs, as if he was counting them. But his real purpose was to cross the sea on the bridge made by the sharks. However, he couldn’t control his excitement, and said when he jumped over the last shark “You have been deceived by me!”. The sharks went furious against him when he unveiled his real intentions, and assaulted him violently. He then lied on the ground for hours, until he was discovered by the eighty brothers who were ahead of /Oonamuji/. He told them his story and asked for advice. “Bathe in the salt water, and lie down exposed to the wind under the sun.” was their proposal. He followed their words, only to end up in a deplorable state, as the salt dried on his wounds.

“Go quickly now to the river, wash thy body with the fresh water, then take the pollen of the sedges growing at the river-mouth, spread it about, and roll about upon it, then hide in the shade; whereupon thy body will certainly be restored to its original state.” Instructed /Oonamuji/.

The white hare of /Inaba/ did as he was told, and his body restored to its original state. The creature promised /Oonamuji/ that the princess will choose him for his gentle heart.
