After /Izanagi/gave birth to the three children, /Amaterasu/, /Susanowo/ and /Tsukiyomi/, during his purification act, /Susanowo/ wept like mad, and declared that he wishes to join his mother /Izanami/ in the land of darkness, /Yomi/. Furious, /Izanagi/expelled him. /Susanowo/ decided to bid farewell to his sister before descending, but his outrageous behavior caused /Amaterasu/ to seclude herself in a cave, depriving the earth from daylight. In order to bring /Amaterasu/out and vanquish darkness, myriads of deities gathered at the entrance of the cave, and devised a plan. They hung a mirror in the opposite direction of the rock blocking the entrance and started rejoicing and laughing out loud at /Ameno-uzume/’s dance. As Amaterasu grew curious, she peeped from the entrance, and got dazzled by the reflexion of her own light on the mirror. The deity /Amenota-jikarawo/took the opportunity and pulled her out. Thus light came back once again.

/Susanowo/ was expelled definitely from the valley of heaven. He ended up in /Izumo/, where he met an old couple and their daughter weeping of fear from the eight-headed snake, /Yamata no orochi/, who came everyday to claim one of their daughters. /Susanowo/ offered a deal: getting rid of the monster if they accept to marry him their daughter, /Kushinada-hime/. After he got their accord, he set a trap to /Yamata no orochi/, enticing him to drink saké and let his guard down. Everything went according to /Susanowo’/s plan, and he succeeded in finishing off the giant eight-headed snake. He wedded /Kushinada-hime/, and settled down in /Suga/, where they started bearing offsrpings.
