In the previous entries, I went over all the Kami and places names both in Romaji and Kanji, as well as the translation according to Hall Chamberlain. However, being exhaustive and thorough may come on the expense of memorizing the key parts and events. Thus I decided to write a short entry that goes over all the past events, briefly, so as to ease following the threads of the chronicles, for me, as well as for anyone who takes the trouble to read my writings!

Well it all started before the creation of the universe, the time when the Yin and Yang weren’t separated. The clean, pure elements of the universe created the heavens, whereas the murky components formed the earth afterwards. Divine entities, called Kami, were born spontaneously between Heavens and Earth. Five Kami appeared first, then disappeared for undefined reasons. The “Seven Kami generations” followed, with the last 5 generations having always a Kami and a Megami , a kind of Japanese Goddesses. The two deities in the last generation were Izanagi, the male deity, and Izanami, the female deity. They were sent by the other Kami to create the land and populate it. They stood on the bridge between heaven and earth and stirred with a holy spear until an island was created. They went down and populated it. Izanami called Izanagi to perform the divine intercourse to give birth to other deities and lands. However their first child was a failure, and so was their second try. They investigated the matter with the other Kami, and grasped the truth of the matter: for an intercourse to be successful, Izanagi, the male has to call Izanami first. So they did and gave birth to the Japanese archipelago as well as a handful of deities. Izanami bore Kagutsushi, the spirit of fire, whose birth caused her genital parts to burn . She fell sick and died soon afterwards to be sent to Yomi, the underground realm of Hades. Izanagi couldn’t stand being separated with his partner, so he slayed his son Kagutsushi and went to the land of Yomi to bring her back. She couldn’t show him her face, for fear of being disgusted, but he insisted and followed her deep in Yomi, until he was able to catch a glimspe of her rotting body. She was furious against him since he disobeyed her, and sent her evil troops after him. He showed great courage and pushed them back, prompting her to follow him herself. He ended outside of Yomi, blocking the entrance with a huge boulder and leaving Izanami on the other side. He went afterwards to a river to purify his body of the filth of Yomi. Many Kami were born from his garbs and items that he took off while cleansing his bidy, but the most notable were Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun, Susanowo, the god of wind and Tsukiyomi, the god of the moon.
