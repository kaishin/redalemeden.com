Hi everyone. I was intending to write a Shinwa entry tonight, but time went so fast that I have barely managed to read some news over at  [Japan probe](https://web.archive.org/web/20070509103642/http://www.japanprobe.com/?p=1238)  (props to James for pre-browsing the news sites for me), and watch some  [Koichiro Tsujikawa’s videos](https://web.archive.org/web/20070509103642/http://www.tsujikawakoichiro.com/works_en.html)  (spotted at  [Pink tentacle](https://web.archive.org/web/20070509103642/http://www.pinktentacle.com/2007/02/videos-by-koichiro-tsujikawa-cornelius/) )…

光陰矢のごとし　(/Kouin ya no gotoshi/), 光陰 (/Kouin/) is an old synonym of 時間 (/Jikan/), which means time. It is written as a compound of two Kanji, the first is 光 (/Hikari )/meaning light, and the second is 陰 /(Kage/) ,which stands for shadow.
矢 (/Ya/) means arrow and ごとし (Gotoshi) means “like” or “as if”, usually written as 如し.

This is enough to figure out the meaning of this Kotowaza I guess…
Have a nice day!
