# Stereotypes…

If there is one thing I despise to death, it must be *cultural stereotypes*. It is true that every culture/country is stereotyped in other places in the world, but I kind of have the feeling that Nippon is one of the most stereotyped countries on this globe! And probably it’s just me who thinks so!
 [This article ](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://www.indiana.edu/%7Ejapan/Digests/press-pfv.htm) talks about the way Nippon and Nipponjin are portrayed in American mainstream media . As the article states, Nippon is often wrongly presented in American and European press, being the main source of info for the populace, it ends up eventually in a distorted image in the minds of laymen. I have met many people from different parts of the world, each with their own “selection” of stereotypes , that are so unfounded and nonsensical that it would be degrading to cite some as an example. You can have a look on what kind of thoughts cross people’s mind about Nippon on  [this website](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://www.justiceforjapan.net.ms/) (be warned , there are some offending words). It is also to note that stereotypes are somewhat “scaled”. Japan for some is only Sushi and Sumo, for others it’s only anime and video games, the latter being a more knowledgeable strereotype. For many Gaijin who have never been to Japan eventually, Nipponjin are mysterious people, they are different from average humans, and thus the way they think and feel is also different…
Nowadays with internet, blogs and matching services, things are getting much better than before, and the image people have on Nippon is starting to change. However it doesn’t seem like everyone is ready to listen to the other and understand his thaughts and feelings!! Ignorance is human’s number ONE enemy!!
