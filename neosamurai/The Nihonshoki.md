Beside the oldest extant Japanese text, the  [Kojiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172600/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/06/japanese-mythology-origins.html) , the Nihonshoki (日本書紀) or Nihongi(日本紀) is the second most important source of Shinwa. It was compiled in the Nara period (710-794) , and more precisely in 720AD under the supervision of Prince Toneri. The Nihonshoki is much more abundant of valuable mythological and hystorical events, facts, and stories than its predecessor, the Kojiki. It is divided into 30 chapters, each dealing with an empror , except the two first ones that contain mythical stories, so as to cover from the beginning of the world, till the reign of empror Jito in 697. Unlike the Kojiki , the Nihongi was compiled based on many documents, including Chinese and Korean Baekje texts. Not only it refers to these sources throughout the book, but it cites different versions of some events , accrediting each to its original text. Both the merits of the virtuous rulers and the mistakes of the bad ones were mentioned in the Nihongi, which highlights its relative objectivity compared to the kojiki. Another substantial difference between the two, is the fact that Kojiki was written in transliterated Japanese with Chinese characters, whereas Nihonshoki was written in classical Chinese as was common for any official documents at that time.
