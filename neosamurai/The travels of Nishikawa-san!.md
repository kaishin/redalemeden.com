If going around the globe with your canvas and watercolours is your hobby, then there is someone from whom you can learn a lot! Nishikawa-san is an over 60 years old Japanese artist who tours the world with his “F-1 size sketch book and a set of water paints in the pocket of his jacket”, as he stated in his English webpage. Nishikawa-san’s sketches are interesting in the way they picture the scenery at a given moment from his very own point of view. Even though they are not as detailed as a photograph, they are full of life. Unlike taking photos, that ends as soon as the shutter is pressed, sketches allow the person to enjoy and interact with the scene even more. New york, England, Peru, France, China, South Korea, were but few of the many destinations depicted in Nishikawa-san’s sketches. The website is in Japanese, but there is a English page, so give it a try if you like art, it is indeed worth browsing!
