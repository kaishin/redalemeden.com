Bushido (武士道) is a set of principles, a code of conduct and a way of life of the samurai (warrior) class in feudal Japan. Bushido means literally the way/path of the warrior.To the contrary of what many tend to believe, bushido isn’t a written code, it’s an ethical legacy handed down from mouth to mouth or coming from the pen of some well-known warriors or scholars. Getting a hold of what bushido comprises of is not within reach, and trying to confine it to a mere definition is inappropriate. To understand bushido, one has to think of a strict ,even stoic, self-discpline behaviour, that puts forward several values above everything else.
Those values can be summed up as:

“君に忠、親に孝、自らを節すること厳しく、下位の者に仁慈を以てし、敵には憐みをかけ、私欲を忌み、公正を尊び、富貴よりも名誉を以て貴しとなす”

くんにちゅう、おやにこう、みずからをせっすることきびしく、かいのものにじんじをもってし、てきにはあわれみをかけ、しよくをいみ、こうせいをたっとび、ふうきよりもめいよをもってたっとしとなす。

“Faithfulness to one’s master, filial piety, relentless self-discipline, benevolance towards one’s subordinates, pity towards one’s enemies, self-denial, esteem justice , honor above all” (aproximate translation)

Tracking back bushido origins is practically inconceivable, since it wasn’t the masterpiece of a single person, nor the work achieved by a group of scholars, but it was rather the essence of the samurai class that unfolded gradually throughout the warring years since the 11th century, and that came into full bloom in the first half of the 19th century.
