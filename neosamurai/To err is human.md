*THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 2006*

I vowed to get back on track with my blog updates. I feel sleepy and tired to write an elaborate entry, so I’ll make a swift update, just to not break my promise.
Tonight I am going over the Kotowaza (Japanese proverbs) that convey the meaning of “anyone can make mistakes” .
* 猿も木から落ちる (/Saru mo ki kara ochiru/) : This one is a direct translation of the western “Even monkeys fall from trees”, meaning that even experts make mistakes in their own fields.
* こうぼうも筆の誤り (/Koubou mo fude no ayamari/) Koubou is a buddhist priest who was famous for his calligraphy, the kotowaza means lit. “Even Koubou made mistakes with his brush”
* 河童も川流れ (/Kappa mo kawa nagare/), well this one is quite interesting, in the way that it is distinctively Japanese. It means literally “Even Kappa can be taken by the stream”… And since Kappa is unique to Japanese culture, it is rather more appealing, from my stand point… but wait! what is a Kappa? I am too sleepy to write about Obakemono (huh?) stories, so I’ll save it for tomorrow!
