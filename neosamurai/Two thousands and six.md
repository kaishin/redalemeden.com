*FRIDAY, DECEMBER 29, 2006*


Another year comes and goes, time keeps flowing, and so does the countdown of our lives…
A lot happened in these 365 days though… Of course I am talking about the peninsula in the far east of the Asian continent, commonly called Japan, Nippon, or often referred to as the land of the rising sun.
If you were hibernating since January 2006, then it is time to catch up:

To the delight of Japan, the imperial family finally begot a male heir , Prince Hisahito , son of Prince Akishino and Princess Kiko. Discussions that took place concerning law revisions to allow the imperial succession of female heirs were all halted.

The Elvis personator, Junichirou Koizumi, finally stepped down, leaving his PM post to Shinzou Abe who won a landslide victory against his rivals. Prior to this, the Yasukuni shrine issue caused a diplomatic uproar, and further breached the gap between Japan and her closest neighbors, namely South Korea and China, adding up to a number of other issues such as territorial disputes and historical controversies. Abe visited officially Beijing and Seoul , in an attempt mend the diplomatic relations. 
Also rising as serious threat to Japan’s security, is North Korea and its nuclear program. Norks refused categorically to accept Japan in the six-party talks, after Japan boycotted N.Korea economically and diplomatically as a response to its nuclear tests conducted underground.

Abe’s educational reform and Defense Agency promotion plans didn’t preclude his popularity from decreasing after a series of scandals surfaced involving his office. Rumors of his imminent resignation started to spread recently.

Sports-wise,Japan has reaped several international victories in 2006, namely thanks to the Ice queen, Shizuka Arakawa who won the only Japanese gold medal in the Turin winter Olympics. Team Japan has also proved to the world that Japan has got some of the world’s best Baseball players, after it came number 1 in the first edition of World Baseball Classic. The recent Japanese players local and cross-pacific transfers came to further prove this fact.

Beside the slight economical recovery, corporate scandals were the most significant stories in the economical and business news of 2006. First is Takafumi Horie’s Livedoor scandal, or “Horiemon” ,one of the most prominent Japanese businessmen of the 21st centrury,who was nabbed for securities fraud. Then Yoshiaki Murakami of M&A; Consulting Inc. who was arrested for insider trading.

Socially, bullying, suicides and drunk driving were the highlights of 2006. The government is taking serious punitive measures against drunk drivers,those who accompany them and even those who provide the booze. While schools are having trouble to cope with the rising numbers of bullied pupils who throw away their lives. Some schools tried to come up with emergency measures to deal with the issue, but in the lack of an effective governmental intervention to solve the problem from its roots, the results are almost unnoticeable.
2006 was undeniably the year of high end technology, from the humanoid androids and patrol robots, to the new generation of home consoles, namely Nintendo Wii and Sony PS3 that were launched this year, en passant by various new technologies that will be part of daily life in the near future.


Happy New Year Japan!!
