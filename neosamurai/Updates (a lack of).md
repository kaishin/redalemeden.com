# Updates (a lack of)
#website/neosamurai

*THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2006*

Here I am after almost one week of no updates. But anyway, I am not intending to start whining about my tight schedule nor anything of the kind…
I have recorded the first episode of my Doujin music podcast, and uploaded it, but I am still trying to get it referenced on podcasting websites. I guess Doujin music and mythology just don’t get along well, so I will be putting up a separate website for the podcast, where you may find the show notes, links, etc… I’ll communicate the link as soon as the page is ready.I’ll be resuming my Shinwa writings, the trip of Oonamuji, the honest younger brother who saved the wounded white hare.
