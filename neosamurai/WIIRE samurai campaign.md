The association of soccer and samurai is becoming more and more popular. Konami have launched lately  [a campain site ](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172638/http://www.konami.jp/we/samurai/) to promote [ Winning eleven 10](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172638/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_Eleven) . The avatar of their campain is a samurai with number 10 written on his back, both referring to the tenth version of the game, and to the fact that this number is reserved for the most active centre forward (attacker) in soccer.
The Wiire ウイイレ (pronounced wee-rei) is entitled ウイイレ侍がゆく！！
which means “The Wiire Samurai has gone” (based on my elementary knowledge of Japanese)!
By the way Wiire is the abbreviation of Winning Eleven, pronounced in Japan as ウイニングイレベン (Uiningu Ireben), and by combining the two first Katakana of each word, you get ウイイレ , Uiire or Wiire!!
Actually in Japan, almost EVERY COMPLICATED word is abbreviated!
