Two days ago, a friend of mine sent me a nice piece of music, from the video game I used to enjoy back in PSX days,  [Ape Escape](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ape_Escape)  or Saru! Get you!  [サルゲッチュ](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B5%E3%83%AB%E3%82%B2%E3%83%83%E3%83%81%E3%83%A5)  in Japanese.
The game is about catching monkeys with a net. even though the idea seems basic, the game is really rich and entertaining, and the monkeys won’t miss the chance to pull out some bad tricks on you… Anyway, I brought up this topic because there is one song that particularly caught my attention…

The title of this song is Wabi-Sabi wall. As you all know , Wabi-Sabi is the green horse radish that is used in Japanese cuisine, it’s very hot and…違う！ That is Wasabi !!

Wabi-Sabi is one of the Japanese aesthtics that are very hard to put into words, especially in foreign languages, and I do mean by foreign 外国語 (Gaikokugo). According to the English  [wikipedia’s definition](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi_sabi) , Wabi-sabi (in Kanji: 侘寂) represents a comprehensive Japanese world view or aesthetic centred on the acceptance of transience. However when I read this, I was confused, since Mono No Aware means practically the same thing : /Mono no aware (物の哀れ, mono no aware) is a Japanese term used to describe the awareness of the transience of things, and a gentle sadness at their passing./ Thus I headed to the  [Japanese Wikipedia](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%8F%E3%81%B3%E3%83%BB%E3%81%95%E3%81%B3)  to see what is 和 (WA)’s definition of the word.
In the Japanese definition ; the term is divided into two parts corresponding to the two kanjis composing the compound:
/Wabi/, The noun derived from the verb /Wabu/, means “the superiority of imperfection” (Very aproximate translation of “/rippa na joutai ni taisuru otta joutai/“ which gives literally “an inferior state over a perfect one”). I have grasped the meaning of the western culture example, but I can’i put it really in words, for fear of conveying a wrong image. In other words, we can say “Humble/Simple/Plain state/appearance”. Essentially, there isn’t a concrete concept that can explain it even in Japanese.

*「侘*（*わび*、*侘び*とも）とは、動詞「*わぶ*」の名詞形で、その意味は「立派な状態に対する劣った状 態」となる。西洋文化にある状態で例えて言えば、パーティーが行われていないパーティー会場がこれに近い。転じては「粗末な様子」、あるいは「簡素な様 子」を意味している。日本aでも本来的は良い概念ではなかったが、これが積極的に評価され美意識の中にとりこまれていった。」

As for /Sabi/, it is similarly the noun derived from the verb /sabu/, and it means the deterioration of things as time flows. In English, the kanji refers to “patina” (fine coating of oxide on the surface of a metal, it is usually green). In my own words, the wear that manifests in things such as the patina, repairs, rust… creates an atmosphere that has a certain beauty in it, and the appreciation of this beauty can be described as /Sabi/.

*「寂*（*さび*、*寂び*とも）は動詞「*さぶ*」の名詞形で、本来は時間の経過によって劣化した様子（経年変化）を意味している。…。 英語ではpatina（緑青）の美が類似のものとして挙げられ、緑青などが醸し出す雰囲気についてもpatinaと表現される。」

This said , combining the two kanji may give anythng similar to “the beauty of imperfection, incompletness, and impermanence”, or “the contemplation of the imprefect, the transient, the eroded by time…”.
Even though I tried my best to bring my ideas into words, I am still far from the concept. But it is not a thing to worry about, aesthetics are better to be taken as a whole, to understand their essence without trying to limit them by words. And that’s what I appreciate about Japanese traditional sense of beauty (美意識 Biishiki), subtletly, that is!

Anyway, have you ever tried making sushi? have you ever worked in a  [sushiya](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://www.xanga.com/mirai33/523672137/item.html) ?
