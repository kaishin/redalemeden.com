*WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 17, 2007*

Now that I had taken a breather, it is time to resume my  [Shinwa chronicles](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115055/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/12/shinwa-round-up.html) . I stopped in  [Ookuninushi’s arc](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115055/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/12/shinwa-wrap-up-valiant-oonamuji.html)  (大国主),  [when ](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115055/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/12/shinwa-ohokuninushis-victory.html) he went back from the Land of /Yomi/and terrorized his 80 brothers as advised by /Susanowo/. He bore a child with his new bride/,Suseri-bime/(スせりビメ) , and continued making the land , that was halted since [ the death of Izanami](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115055/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/09/shinwa-slaying-of-kagutsushi.html) .  [Yagami-hime ](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115055/http://neosamurai.blogspot.com/2006/11/shinwa-oonamujis-hardships.html) (ヤガミ姫), the beautiful princess of /Inaba/ who had an eye on /Ookuninushi/ and accepted to marry him, was jealous of his official bride /Suseribime./ She hence abducted their child and stuck it on a branch of a tree then fled to her parents place, thus the baby was baptised /Kinomata (no-kami)/ 木之又神, meaning “Tree-Fork-Deity”. From that point on, /Ookuninushi/ was given an alias of /Yachihoko/, an abbreviation of /Hachi-Sen-Hoko-Kami/ (八千矛神), or “One thousand spear Kami”.

Yachihoko packed and left for the land of Koshi, where an attractive maiden called /Nunakaha-Hime/ ヌナカハヒメ（沼河比売） is rumored to dwell. When he arrived he met her, and exchanged love poems. /Suseribime/ felt an immense jealousy when her groom left her behind. He was aware of her grief, and , distressed, he composed a song on his way back from  [Izumo province](https://web.archive.org/web/20070519115055/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/Japan_prov_map_izumo.PNG)  to soothe her. Once he uttered his well chosen words on the back of his horse in front of her , she offered him a saké cup and sang, saying:

“Oh! Thou, my dear Ookuninushi indeed, being a man, probably hast on the various islands that thou seest, and on every beach that thou lookest on, a wife like the young herbs. But as for me alas! being a woman, I have no man except thee; I have no spouse except thee. “
