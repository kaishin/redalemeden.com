I apologize by the same occasion for the lack of updates. I have resumed classes and I am working on some projects. I have also started contributing on  [Japundit ](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://www.japundit.com/) since last week, and has written four posts so far, the latest being a short entry about the  [Sengoku Village put on sale on Rakuten](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://japundit.com/archives/2006/10/11/3800/) . I highly advise anyone who doesn’t have enough time to browse the web for Japan-related news to check Japundit as well as the weekly podcast show  [Japantalk](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://www.japantalk.org/) . I’d like also to notify all of you who are interested in learning Japanese that Japan Probe has put up a complete list of youtube links for the Japanese learning program  [Let’s Learn Japanese.](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://www.japanprobe.com/?p=589)  I am uploading the program textbooks with the complete transcripts, lessons and exercises in PDF format (I don’t know about their copyright status, so please notify me if this violates any), [ click here ](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://www.oxyshare.com/get/963397463452e949cbd0210.74708773/Lets%20Learn%20Japanese%20Basic%20I%20and%20II.zip.html) to download them.
