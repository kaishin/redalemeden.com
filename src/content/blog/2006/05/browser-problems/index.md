A blog directory notified me that Neo Samurai looks broken in Internet Explorer.
You don't say! I haven't used IE in years and I hate it, but it's frustrating to
see how poorly the site renders on it, so I'll adjust the frame width and sidebar
link sizes to improve compatibility.

If you're still on IE please consider using [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.com/firefox/)
or [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) instead.
