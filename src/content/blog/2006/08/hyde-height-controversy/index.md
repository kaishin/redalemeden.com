While browsing [Mari's Watashi to
Tokyo](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://smt.blogs.com/mari_diary/),
I stumbled upon an [amusing
story](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172136/http://www.typepad.com/t/trackback/4033827)
about Hyde (pronounced Haido), the vocalist of L'arc~en~ciel, and his Wikipedia
entry.

Hyde has never publicly revealed his height, keeping it a closely guarded
secret. This hasn't stopped 2-channel users from vandalizing his Japanese
Wikipedia page, inserting the rumored height of 156cm throughout the article in
increasingly absurd ways. The edits escalated until the page was eventually
locked.

I checked the page history and found some highlights. The number 156 appeared
everywhere:

- **156hyde** (ひゃくごじゅうろくハイド) は日本の身長156cm5'2"ヴォーカリスト —
  "156Hyde (One hundred fifty six Hyde) is Japan's 156cm (5'2") height
  vocalist."

- 身長(実は156cm)、体重、生年月日等のプロフィールを完全に隠して…そして身長が56cm
  であることを公表した。 — "Height (truth is that it's 156cm), Hyde's body
  height, and birth date are kept hidden in Hyde's profile…Then he announced
  officially that his body height is 156cm."

- さらにはドラム、アルトサックスなど多様な楽器を身長156cmながら操ることができ
  る。 — "Furthermore, even though he is 156cm, he can play various instruments
  including drums, alto sax…"

- 156年1月56日生まれ — "He was born in the year 156, month 1, 56th."

The vandals also created an entire discography of bands Hyde allegedly played
in, each name incorporating "156" in some form: 156, 国道156号線 (National
Highway 156), 156センチ (centi), 156センチメーター (centimeters), 1.56m, 1560mm,
百五十六 (one hundred fifty six), 山本五十六 (Yamamoto 56), and ひゃくごじゅうろ
くはいど (156cm haido)—alongside his actual bands like L'Arc〜en〜Ciel and HYDE,
plus random additions like Gackt, Nirvana, and Metallica.

The English Wikipedia still contains subtle references to this rumor. The French
wiki lists 158cm, while the Japanese one hedges with a range from 156cm to
160cm, emphasizing that Hyde has never officially confirmed his height.

_Thanks to Mari for the original story._
