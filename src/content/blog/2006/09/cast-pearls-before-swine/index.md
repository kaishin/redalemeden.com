The Japanese equivalent of "cast pearls before swine" is 猫に小判 ([NEKO NI KOBAN](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/5623/06.wav)), literally "coins to a cat"—don't offer something to someone incapable of using it properly.

A [koban](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://image.space.rakuten.co.jp/lg01/21/0000136021/62/imgaa839445chvk3g.jpeg) was an oval gold coin used during the Edo period. The Pokemon [Meowth](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meowth) (Nyasu in Japanese) has a koban on its forehead.

There's also 豚に真珠 ([BUTA NI SHINJU](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/5623/07.wav)), "pearls to a pig," which is closer to the English phrase. But I prefer the cat version.
