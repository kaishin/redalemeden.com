## Geisha Apprenticeship Levels

For those interested in geisha culture beyond the typical media coverage, [Geisha Immortal](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.immortalgeisha.com/index.html) offers detailed explanations. [Their FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.immortalgeisha.com/faq_geisha.php) clarifies the distinctions between geisha, maiko, and geiko—terms often used interchangeably but representing different apprenticeship levels.

## Firefox Japan Campaign

Mozilla is promoting Firefox in Japan with a fox mascot, fitting for [the land of kawaii](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii). They're [running a contest](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://spreadfirefox.jp/mascot/) to name the mascot. I submitted フォクシー (Foxy). (via [Japan Probe](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.japanprobe.com/?p=458))

## Shinzo Abe and Japanese Nationalism

The Washington Post published [an article](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/25/AR2006082501176_pf.html) on rising Japanese nationalism, arguing that Japan needs nationalism but not at the expense of freedom of expression.

Shinzo Abe, the likely successor to PM Junichiro Koizumi, has declared his intention to upgrade the Defence Agency to full ministry status, amend education laws to boost patriotism, and expand Japan's military presence overseas. (via [The Hindu](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/003200609031551.htm))

I see this as moving toward building a [proud Japan](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172119/http://www.s-abe.or.jp/), as Abe's website proclaims.
