The Toukaidou Gojuusan Tsugi ([東海道五十三次](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9D%B1%E6%B5%B7%E9%81%93%E4%BA%94%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%89%E6%AC%A1)) refers to the 53 stations along the Toukaidou, the Edo-Kyoto highway during the Edo period.

Eighteen mangaka recently collaborated on a [manga scroll](https://web.archive.org/web/20061107172015/http://homepage1.nifty.com/nagaragawagarou/A-208.htm) depicting these stations in traditional Japanese style with a satirical edge.
