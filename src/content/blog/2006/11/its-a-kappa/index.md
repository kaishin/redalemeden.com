Kappa are among the most prominent obake (お化け)—ghosts, goblins, and monsters—in Japanese folklore.

These aquatic creatures have humanoid shapes with monkey faces, predatory beaks, turtle shells, and frog limbs. Their scaly skin ranges in color, though blue and green are most common. They live in rivers and emerge when hungry, feeding on children, shirikodama (尻子玉, a mythical energy ball in the anus), and cucumbers.

The kappa's defining feature is a water-filled organ on top of its head, surrounded by bushy hair. This organ keeps the kappa alive on land, but if the water spills, the creature dies instantly. Tradition holds that bowing to a kappa prompts it to bow back, spilling its survival water. Kappa are also said to be skilled in traditional medicine and fluent in Japanese.

Warning signs near rivers still caution children about kappa, though no one has ever photographed one. The legend likely originated from the practice of floating stillborn fetuses down rivers, or as a cautionary tale using the swollen anus of drowning victims as "proof" of shirikodama theft.
