Neo Samurai's archives begin in May 2006, but I deliberately deleted everything before that. The blog has existed for over a year and a half. I wrote something similar on December 29, 2005, and find myself writing something similar again now.

I'm still standing in the middle of nowhere—or maybe my progress is simply unnoticeable against the vastness of the desert. With nothing but the sun to guide me, I've walked for days that became weeks that became months, only to find myself kneeling, contemplating the horizon. Will I find the oasis, or is it just a mirage? I'm thirsty, afraid, with no one to help in this wilderness. I can't go back—I'd die of thirst before reaching my starting point. My footsteps have been buried under sand dunes, leaving only forward. The blue sky stretches above, witnessing my journey. Following the sun might be my only way out, but staring at it unfiltered could blind me.

I stand up again, determined to reach the end of this path I've chosen. I don't know what lies ahead, but I'm ready to face it, whether it brings my downfall or my glory. This is my journey—the choice is mine, and so are the consequences.

Kaishin, the lost samurai

Thanks to everyone reading this: my friends, fellow netizens who visit Neo Samurai, relatives who've supported me, Ai-san assisting my admission procedure, Nintendo for the DS, and Japan, for giving me a reason to live.

Happy new year.

明けましておめでとうございます
