I've been watching [Death Note](https://web.archive.org/web/20070627180159/http://anidb.info/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=4563)—the plot is original, the characters charismatic, and the animation excellent.

Here's Death Note reimagined from a Simpsons perspective by [Spacecoyote](https://web.archive.org/web/20070627180159/http://spacecoyote.deviantart.com/).
