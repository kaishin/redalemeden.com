It's that time of the year where we mull over what we accomplished in the past
twelve months. Here is my list.

- **Stopped using Google products for personal use.** Migrating my half dozen
  Gmail accounts was the hardest part. That and finding a viable replacement for
  YouTube. Spoiler: It does not exist.

- **Deleted unused online accounts.** This includes LinkedIn, Hulu, and other
  online retailers. Needless to say, I had some unpleasant experiences during
  this process.

- **Uninstalled Flash and Java on OS X.** Surprised I didn't get to this sooner.

- **Enabled two-factor authentication when available.**
  [Authy](https://www.authy.com) and
  [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) for the win.

- **Launched a Mac app on the App Store.** [A
  utility](https://ipinator.kaishin.co) that brings native IP geocoding to OS X.

- **Designed a mobile game.** An unforgiving [space
  survival](http://playroto.to) with a whiff of nostalgia.

- **Co-hosted a podcast.** Props to [Kyle
  Fiedler](https://twitter.com/kylefiedler) for putting up with [my never-ending
  rants](https://twitter.com/tentativefm).

- **Co-organized a Swift workshop.** [It was a lot of
  fun](http://codeswift.thoughtbot.com), especially the part where I had to sit
  back and listen to [Jack Nutting](https://twitter.com/jacknutting) explain
  optionals.

- **Released a Safari extension.** It serves to scratch my own [RSS
  discovery](https://redalemeden.com/syndicate/) itch.

- **Got interviewed.** It's on
  [Workspiration](http://workspiration.org/reda-lemeden).

- **Visited San Francisco during WWDC week.** [It was totally worth
  it](https://twitter.com/kaishin/status/608815115643686913), even without a
  ticket.

- **Avoided buying an Apple Watch.** Believe me, this one was particularly
  challenging.

- **Earned my first Platinum trophy on PSN**. Better yet, it's from
  [Bloodborne](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/bloodborne-ps4/).
