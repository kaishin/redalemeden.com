I haven't updated this blog since I joined thoughtbot in 2012. This was due to a
combination of not having the time to do proper research outside working hours
and finding [better](https://robots.thoughtbot.com) [venues](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/) for technical writing.

Given how tiny my blog audience got over the last three years, I considered
moving to Medium as a way to grow my readership though social connections. But
that idea didn't last long; no amount of perks can convince me to write on a
closed platform where I can't affect neither the writing nor the reading
experience.

In the end, I decided to move the old content from `kaishinlab.com` to this blog
and set up redirects when necessary---a prime example of the freedom you unlock
when you have control over you data.

It feels good to be back.
