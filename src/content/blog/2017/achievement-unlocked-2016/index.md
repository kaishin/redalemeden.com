Between a new job, a house move, and a flurry of depressing news, my
productivity took a hit in 2016. I was nevertheless able to do some fun things
on the side:

- Built and launched [Speedster](https://speedsterapp.com), a native bandwidth
  speed testing app for macOS. The feedback was very positive, but I [struggled
  with the business model](/2016/speedster-a-retrospective). As of this writing,
  the app is no longer available on the App Store, while version 3.0 is still in
  the works (more on that later).

- Launched then open-sourced [Markoff](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Markoff), a
  lightweight Markdown previewer app for macOS.

- Published [three](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/building-ios-interfaces-views)
  [more](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/building-ios-interfaces-custom-button)
  [articles](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/building-ios-interfaces-subclassing-views)
  in the *Designing for iOS* series that I started back in 2015.

- [Customized an arcade stick](https://twitter.com/kaishin/status/706076592976629761) ðŸ•¹ and had a ton
  of fun doing it.

- Designed a macOS [replacement icon](https://dribbble.com/shots/2730205-Undertale-Replacement-Icon) for
  [Undertale](http://undertale.com/).

- Released [ImageScout 1.0](https://github.com/kaishin/ImageScout), a Swift
  implementation of `fastimage`.

- Made a [visualization](/2016/swift-3-access-control) on Swift 3.0 Access
  control.

- Gave [a talk](https://speakerdeck.com/kaishin/swift-3-api-best-practices-by-example)
  about Swift API guidelines at CocoaHeads Stockholm.

- Released [Gifu](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Gifu) 2.0 after 3 months of
  testing. The new version is written in Swift 3.0 and introduces a new
  protocol-based API that makes the library a lot more versatile.

- Removed all analytics from my websites.

- Rewrote Speedster in Swift 3.0 and dropped the dependency on the
  [SpeedOfMe](https://speedof.me) API.

- Resumed recording [Tentative](http://tentative.fm) and the [1st episode](http://tentative.fm/31)
  of the season is already out!
