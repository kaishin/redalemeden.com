Dark mode support for this website, fresh out of the oven.

I have a soft spot for dark interfaces. So much so that the several instances I
had to switch back to light mode while working on this made me feel inexplicably
uncomfortable.

Since I had already done the legwork of using CSS variable for the colors used
throughout the site, it was relatively easy to implement this new dark theme.
Here is [the
commit](https://github.com/kaishin/redalemeden.com/commit/ae27e217dd2df9438ed81edbc8230103c55e7793)
for those of you interested in the nitty-gritty details.

Currently the site takes the same appearance as the <abbr title="Operating
System">OS</abbr>, but I am entertaining the idea of adding a manual toggle
sometime down the road.
