IBM has [unofficially
announced](https://forums.swift.org/t/december-12th-2019/31735) that they are
abandoning Swift and their work within the <abbr title="Swift Server Work
Group">SSWG</abbr> starting 2020. Sad news, given that their stewardship of
Kitura and clout in the enterprise market gave a much-needed credence boost to
Swift in the server-side space.

Four years since Apple open-sourced Swift and made it run on Linux, the
ecosystem still has ways to go to stand on its own as a battle-tested stack that
attracts developers from other established communities. With that being said,
this process has been accelerated since <abbr title="Swift Server Work
Group">SSWG</abbr> started a little over a year ago; they since have been doing
a remarkable job with reconciling different projects and focusing on key modular
components that benefit the community at large.

While this news is a bit of a setback, I firmly believe that server-side Swift's
best days are still ahead of it.
