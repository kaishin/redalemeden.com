Today marks a new beginning for this blog. After a long hiatus, I am finally
back to writing, and I couldn’t be happier about it.

Six weeks in, I can confidently say that 2019 is off to a good start for me. I
am slowly breaking free of the constant feeling of anxiety and pressure that
paralyzed me a great deal throughout last year, thanks in no small part to
healthier habits and a renewed sense of purpose.

Capitalizing on this newfound energy, I concocted an action plan to achieve the
goals I set for myself this year. And it starts here.

Since last fall, I’ve been deliberately distancing myself from Twitter. My
over-reliance on it as a medium for hot takes and shallow interactions inhibited
my drive to write longer, more reflective pieces. The result is a trail of
abandoned blogs and writing experiments that didn’t get the attention they
deserve.

To address that, I will commit to writing one short essay per month, for the
next 12 months, about one of the topics that have been preoccupying me---the
first of which is drafted and will be out shortly after this one.

On top of that, I started the process of migrating older essays and entries to
this blog, setting up permanent redirects when necessary. The RSS feed has moved
to a [new URL](/feed.xml) and is now also available as a [JSON Feed](/feed.json).

Beside these changes, the website itself got a much needed facelift. The new
design uses a more vivid color palette with an increased focus on contrast. It
also introduces a unified type system across all pages of the site; something
that was hard to achieve when three font families were in simultaneous use. As a
bonus, all fonts are now self-hosted instead of being served through Google
Fonts.

Under the hood, I started using a self-hosted instance of [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) to add a
thin, privacy-minded layer of metrics. The anonymous data will be used to gauge
interest in certain topics and keep an eye on the overall activity happening on
the site.

In closing, I'm very pleased with the outcome, and I'm pumped to resume writing
about things that matter to me. Onward and upward!
