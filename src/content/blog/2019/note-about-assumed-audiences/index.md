title: "A Note About Assumed Audiences"

You might have noticed that I’ve been opening every
[Unredacted](https://redalemeden.com/blog) article with a sentence describing
the assumed audience. The intention behind this is to help readers quickly
determine if the content aligns with their interests, especially given the
non-thematic nature of the blog.

I first saw this pattern on Chris Krycho’s
[blog](https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/assumed-audiences.html), and immediately
fell in love with it. The ability to juggle between the generic and the
specific, the momentous and the mundane, the subjective and the objective, is
the main selling point of a personal blog. This editorial freedom, however,
often comes at the price of readership loyalty.

Adopting this habit as an author should *in theory* alleviate some of the burden
on visitors, both new and returning, of figuring out whether the content matches
their interests.

Granted, it’s not an exact science, and I welcome everyone---especially the
curious among you---to read past the disclaimer even when it doesn’t appear to
be an exact match at first glance.
