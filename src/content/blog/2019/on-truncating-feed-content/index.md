While skimming my RSS subscriptions this morning, I came across [this
tidbit](https://inessential.com/2019/09/04/on_the_many_netnewswire_feature_requests)
from NetNewsWire:

Let me be clear about this: Truncating content in RSS feeds is, without a sliver
of doubt, an accessibility issue first and foremost. Accessibility as in making
your content accessible to your readers wherever they *chose* to subscribe to
your feeds---be it a mobile app, a command line, or through a screen reader.
Undermining this aspect and coercing them to visit your website, no matter how
much love you poured into it, is short-sighted at best, and inconsiderate at
worst.

I get that authors need to pay the bills, and some of them resort to
sponsorships or ads to do so. But it’s user-hostile to presume that your
subscribers don’t know any better and that they can only enjoy your content
directly on your website.

Authors who care about their readership have already figured out perfectly
legitimate ways to monetize their feeds without any content truncation. Those
who don’t are unlikely to bother and will continue to do a disservice to their
readers.

In the meantime, industrious developers will keep finding workarounds to restore
functionality that users yearn for. And nothing can stop that, because open
*always* wins.
