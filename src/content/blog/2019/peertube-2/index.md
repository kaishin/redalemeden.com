The nice folks over at Framasoft have been doing a tremendous job with PeerTube
in general, and [this
release](https://framablog.org/2019/11/12/peertube-has-worked-twice-as-hard-to-free-your-videos-from-youtube/)
in particular.

For those unfamiliar, PeerTube is the Mastodon of video---a federated video
platform that uses the [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks) protocol to
connect multiple independent instances. Any individual or organization can run
their own instance and have total control over their content and communities.

I am very excited to see this platform evolve and get more traction the world
over. Hating on YouTube is *cliché* these days, but the service deserves every
bit of it. [And then
some](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/23/20946114/google-youtube-premium-subscription-ads-pop-ups-spam-rant).

Now, I understand that people making a living out of content creation can’t move
to other platforms willy nilly, but that’s exactly the reason why it's important
to get behind projects like these.
