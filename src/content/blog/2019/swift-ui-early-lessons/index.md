We've been using SwiftUI day in and day out since the first beta to build a
non-trivial app at work---a bold move, but one that makes me like my job. Here
are some lessons I've learnt:

* Stick to standard navigation. As unstable as the APIs are for the time being,
  this will spare you the layout and accessibility headaches that come with
  custom transitions.

* Always investigate whether your UI can be implemented as a list view. It
  handles dynamic type, dark mode, and other accessibility features out of the
  box, and will likely look more polished as a result.

* Make good use of section headers and footers in `List`. Unlike `UITableView`,
  these are much easier to set up in SwiftUI's declarative syntax. They can be
  used for empty states, search fields, sorting controls, etc.

* Embrace the current limitations of the framework. If you have to fight it at
  every turn to get the result you want, consider taking a different route where
  you don't have to do that. You can revisit the same challenge later as the
  framework matures.

* Donâ€™t use hard coded colors, i.e. the RGB initializer. Use system tint colors
  or asset catalogs instead, and stay clear of white and black as they don't
  adapt to appearance modes.

* Pay attention to the methods used to pass data down to and up from subviews.
  Itâ€™s easy to use the wrong method and the error wonâ€™t be very helpful. Spend
  some time to understand the difference between `@State`, `@Binding`,
  `@ObservedObject`, and `@EnvironmentObject`.

* Speaking of compiler errors, split your view hierarchy using variables,
  methods, and separate view structs to make the wide of the mark error messages
  slightly more relevant and helpful.

* Extract reoccurring view modifier chains into custom modifiers to DRY up the
  code. It's a bit more work that I anticipated, but it's worth it.

* UIKit appearance helpers still work in SwiftUI. call them from within the
  `init()` method of the view when needed. For instance, this is the only method
  to remove the opaque background from a `List` as of now.

* SwiftUI is still very rough around the edges, so keep your cool and stay
  hydrated.ðŸ¥¤
