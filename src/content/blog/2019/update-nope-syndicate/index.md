Since Safari 13 was released [last week](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari_release_notes/safari_13_release_notes)
on macOS, I’ve been getting an unusually high amount of inquiries about the
status of [Nope](https://redalemeden.com/nope/) and
[Syndicate](https://redalemeden.com/syndicate/). This is the TL;DR of the
response I’ve been copy-pasting so far.

I’ve been planning to update these extensions since the deprecation
announcement, but I haven’t managed to find the time to do that yet. This means
that users who relied on either will have to find alternatives in the AppStore.

Both [Nope](https://github.com/kaishin/nope) and
[Syndicate](https://github.com/kaishin/syndicate) are open-source and will
remain so in future iterations. While I don’t have a concrete release window
yet, I still believe in the importance of investing in open-source,
community-driven browser extensions and content blockers.
