As challenging and anomalous as this year has been, I sought to make the best
out of the exceptional circumstances that unfolded. In March I quit my full time
job to focus on a handful of personal projects—a
[conference](https://swiftandfika.com/), a book, and a digital product. While
the first was indefinitely postponed due to the pandemic, being confined at home
was perfect for the remaining two throughout spring and summer—but more on that
hopefully soon. In early fall, I started teaching front-end Web development at
[Hyper Island](https://www.hyperisland.com/programs-and-courses/frontend-developer); a
unique and rewarding experience that I’m not ready to forget any time soon.

Another perk of being stuck at home is having the opportunity to try new things.
I learned how to make rather average pound cakes and play some rudimentary music
on synth. I also played a good dose of competitive Pokémon and Street Fighter V,
with the occasional single player game to keep things fresh. On the minus side,
I have spent far less time with family and friends and missed most of my
swimming sessions.

When all is said and done, this year was a rare chance for me to reflect and
appreciate some of the things I took for granted. Visiting relatives, exercising
in the gym, or going to a concert will certainly feel less mundane whenever I
can do them without a care in the world again.

So, 2020, you haven't been particularly nice, but I am here to bid you farewell.
As for you, 2021, I understand  the expectations are high, but you can't do much
worse than your predecessor, _can you?_
