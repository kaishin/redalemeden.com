As you might have already heard, Apple announced earlier this summer their plans
to turn off <abbr title="Identifier for Advertisers">IDFA</abbr>—a unique device
ID used by advertisers track users across apps. Following the backlash from
online advertisers and mobile game publishers that this move triggered, they
subsequently [backed down](https://www.idropnews.com/news/apple-backs-down-on-ios-14-ad-privacy-after-backlash-from-facebook-and-game-developers/142386/)
this fall when iOS 14 was released.

In the light of this development, Mozilla [put out a page](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/apples-anti-tracking-plans-iphone/)
with a form for users like you and me to show support for Apple's anti-tracking
plans. I signed it and I recommend anyone who cares about online privacy to do
so.

The fact that both Apple and Mozilla generate a lot of revenue, albeit
indirectly, from online and mobile advertising make this move sound puzzling at first,
but the potential gains in terms of brand value and consumer trust would likely
make up for any potential losses.
