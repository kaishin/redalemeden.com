It's refreshing to see [Mattt's reasoned take](https://nshipster.com/wwdc-2020/)
amidst all the attention-seeking headlines this week:

> As it turns out, going fully remote wasn’t merely good enough — it was, in
> many ways, superior to the original thing.  [...] Sessions are tight and
> well-paced. Rather than stretching or cramming content into a fixed time slot,
> they’re as long as they need to be.

This definitely echoes my impressions. As someone who mostly followed along from
home in the past, not only did I not miss much this year, but I got treated to a
much improved remote experience.

Mattt also brings up the topic of Excitement—or _hype_, as I often call it—and
productivity:

> Here’s the thing about excitement: It’s kryptonite to developers. Excitement
> messes with our ability to focus on one thing, which is already a big struggle
> for a lot of us (myself included). When you’re excited, it’s almost impossible
> to get anything done.

This is true for any endeavor, but especially so for software development. 

> There are plenty of voices in the community who are echoing this excitement. I
> can’t add anything to that discussion. And besides, that’s not really where my
> head’s at right now.

The official Apple content generates enough sense of <abbr title="Fear of
Missing Out">FOMO</abbr> as it is. Combining that with a firehose of _What's new
in X_ blog posts, podcasts, YouTube videos, and tweets doesn't help much as far
as I am concerned.

> It’s been an exciting week, so take a moment to collect yourself. Go on a
> walk. Take a hike. (Be safe about it.) Do whatever you need to break free of
> the “reality distortion field”. Once you do, you’ll have the necessary
> distance to determine what new technologies you should pay attention to and
> what you can ignore for now.

Solid advice, WWDC or otherwise.
