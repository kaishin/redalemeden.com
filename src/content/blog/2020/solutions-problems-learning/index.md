From a content creator perspective, it’s relatively easy to write about
solutions. Tips and tricks. How to do X or Y. Lessons learned. In contrast, it’s
significantly harder to write about problems—what's at stake and why it's worth
the effort. Understanding a given problem to a level where it can be distilled
requires much more rigor and experience than presenting solutions to said
problem.

From a learner perspective, especially in their early stages of the learning
process, it is far more worthwhile to understand the problems, challenges, and
tradeoffs than to build a repertoire of solutions. Doing the latter without the
former might work in the short and mid-term, but on the long run it is very
likely to hinder personal and professional growth. Fast food is an apt analogy.

While this dichotomy makes learning certain topics particularly hard, it's not
unsurmountable. One has just to look hard enough.
