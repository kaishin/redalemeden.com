The so-called _iOS-ification_ is often cited as to why the software we use today
on the most powerful hardware we've ever had access to is barely more advanced
than what we used decades ago. I'd argue that the real reasons go much deeper
than that and permeate an entire industry, not just Apple. But let's leave that
for another occasion.

I haven't been keeping tabs on UI regressions in Big Sur, but this all sounds
like hyperbole to me. Especially considering the example the author chose to
illustrate the point:

The argument that more space between elements reduces information density is
well established. But calling it _glaring_ is nothing short of an overstatement.
There is a point beyond which spacing becomes actively harmful in a user
interface, but it's hard to argue that Big Sur crossed that threshold. And I am
saying this both as a long time Mac user and as a UI designer.

I understand that people have different expectations of what a desktop operating
system should be, and that Big Sur is by no means regression-free in the the UI
department. But this sentence is the crux of what I object to in this piece and
others like it; I have a hard time empathizing with the author when all I am
presented with are assumptions and opinions disguised as facts.

Even after all these months, I am still trying to collect my thoughts regarding
Big Sur. My current impression is that it has its highs and lows, like every
software release ever. Some UI decisions, especially around title bars, might
need further adjustments. Some icons need additional pixel hinting. Some
elements need better alignment. But quite frankly, none of it stands out enough
to completely ruin the experience. When you're absorbed in a given task, these
details mostly stay out of your [locus of attention](https://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/locus-of-attention/index.html),
until they hinder your task progression—which might or might not happen
depending on how much attention you pay and how easily distracted you get.

At the end of the day, there is absolutely nothing wrong with people sharing
their experiences and opinions; I am just ranting about a rant so that I can
link people to it when they send me more rants about Big Sur.
