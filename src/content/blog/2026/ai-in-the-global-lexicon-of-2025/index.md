2025 was and will forever be the year I became a dad. Between diaper changes,
I tried to stay in the loop of what's happening in tech, which is to say AI,
since that's pretty much the only topic anyone is talking about these days,
[myself included](https://www.youtube.com/@FullContextAgent).

This spotlight on AI has left its mark on the common parlance of most cultures around
the globe. So much so that almost every new-word list I checked this year had a
couple of AI-related words, if not more. AI terminology has become unavoidable,
universal, and deeply woven into everyday conversation.

English-speaking dictionaries captured both the promise and peril of AI.
Merriam-Webster added "slop" to describe low-quality AI-generated content
flooding social media. Collins recognized "vibe coding," while Cambridge
expanded "parasocial" beyond celebrity relationships to include AI chatbots.

French dictionaries took a different approach. The Petit Robert 2026 showcased
both borrowed and invented terms. "Prompter"
entered the language as a verb for prompting AI systems. Quebec contributed
"hypertrucage" as an alternative to "deepfake," alongside "clonage de voix"
(voice cloning) and "apprentissage profond" (deep learning).

Japan's buzzwords focused less on the technology itself and more on human
interaction with it. ChatGPT became "チャッピー" (Chappii), an affectionate
nickname that transforms impersonal technology into something familiar and
friendly. "AI-エージェント" (AI agent) entered the lexicon for autonomous AI
software. The Chappii nickname reflects Japan's
tendency to come up with endearing or shortened terms to refer to everyday technology.

Swedish largely borrowed English terms directly. "AI-agent" kept the same
spelling, while "vibbkodning" Swedified "vibe coding" with local orthography.

What's worth noting is that every language included words expressing
concerns over AI-generated content quality and uses. English added "slop" for junk
content. Swedish recognized "hjärnröta" (brain rot). French discussions centered
on "hypertrucage" (deepfakes). It's abundantly clear at this stage that many
societies are keeping an eye on AI's potential for harm, and having some of
these words enshrined in major dictionaries signals that these concerns are
being taken seriously.
