# Words I Frequently ~~Mispell~~ Misspell

---

 Here is a list of English words I often get wrong—in spelling, pronunciation, or both:

- ~~Dissmiss~~ **Dismiss**.
- ~~Adress~~ **Address**. From the French spelling of "adresse".
- ~~Substract~~ **Subtract**. From the French "soustraire".
- ~~Appartment~~ **Apartment**. You guessed it, from the french "appartement".
- ~~Negligeable~~ **Negligible**. Yup, in French it's "Négligeable".
- ~~Weary~~ **Wary** (as in cautious).
- ~~Rethoric~~ **Rhetoric**.
- ~~Occurance~~ **Occurence**.
