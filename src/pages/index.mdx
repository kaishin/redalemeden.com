  Hi, my name is *Reda Lemeden*
  <span class="block font-light text-2xl my-1 text-stone-400 dark:text-ash">
  I design and make software, and sometimes I write about it
  </span>
</h2>

Before settling on mobile app development, I worked with graphic design, UI/UX design, web development, game design, and product management.

My programming tools nowadays include Swift, SwiftUI, Astro.js, Deno.js, Vapor, Kotlin, and Jetpack Compose. For design, I use Sketch for 2D and Spline for 3D.

### Backstory

I spent half of my life in my hometown of Casablanca <span title="Morocco">ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¦</span>,
where I grew up playing <span title="Atari, DOS, Nintendo, etc.">video games ðŸŽ®</span> and
tinkering with <span title="Macromedia, Adobe, etc.">creative software ðŸ–Œ</span>.

After getting a <abbr title="Bachelor of Business Administration">BBA</abbr> degree in 2007,
I moved to Tokyo <span title="Japan">ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ</span> to study Japanese,
then Nantes <span title="France">ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·</span> to resume my post-graduate studies (<abbr title="Master in Management">MIM</abbr>),
then Boston, MA <span title="USA">ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</span> to work as a product designer & developer,
before finally settling in Stockholm <span title="Sweden">ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª</span> in 2014. 

These days I write software for a living. If you have any questions or just want to say hi, don't hesitate to get in touch!
