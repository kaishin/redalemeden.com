  Hi, my name is *Reda Lemeden*.
  <span class="my-1 block text-2xl font-light text-stone-400 dark:text-ash">
    I make software for a living, and sometimes I write about it.

</h2>

I thrive when creating people-friendly, visually appealing software that follows
platform conventions. In my spare time, I enjoy drawing manga comics,
learning languages, and playing video games.

### Backstory

I spent half of my life in my hometown of Casablanca <span title="Morocco">🇲🇦</span>,
where I grew up playing <span title="Atari, DOS, Nintendo, etc.">video
games 🎮</span> and tinkering with <span title="Macromedia, Adobe, etc.">creative
software 🖌</span>.

After getting a <abbr title="Bachelor of Business Administration">BBA</abbr>
degree in 2007, I moved to Tokyo <span title="Japan">🇯🇵</span> to study Japanese,
then Nantes <span title="France">🇫🇷</span> to resume my post-graduate studies
(<abbr title="Master in Management">MIM</abbr>), then Boston, MA <span title="USA">
🇺🇸</span> to work as a product designer, before finally settling
in Stockholm <span title="Sweden">🇸🇪</span> in 2014.

These days I write mobile apps for a living. If you have any questions or just want
to say hi, don't hesitate to get in touch!
