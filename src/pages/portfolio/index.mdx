beloved [documentation viewing](https://kapeli.com/dash) for Mac.

During the last 3 years, I worked on Kaching's app protfolio for the retail industry in Sweden and abroad. The role involved
designing hundreds of screens and micro-intreactions, then evolved to leading the design and product teams to deliver, test,
and iterate on the product.
