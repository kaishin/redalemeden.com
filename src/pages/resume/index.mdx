## About Me

After getting a <abbr title="Bachelor of Business Administration">BBA</abbr> degree in 2007 in my hometown of Casablanca <span title="Morocco">ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¦</span>,
I moved to Tokyo <span title="Japan">ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ</span> to study Japanese,
then Nantes <span title="France">ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·</span> to resume my post-graduate studies (<abbr title="Master in Management">MIM</abbr>),
then Boston, MA <span title="USA">ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</span> to work as a product designer & developer,
before finally settling in Stockholm <span title="Sweden">ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª</span> in 2014. 

## Highlights

- I started _Web development_ as a hobby in the early 2000s.
- After 8 years of wrestling CSS tables in Internet Explorer, 
I got inspired by the iPhone to learn _mobile development_.
- In 2010, I wrote _my first mobile app_ in Objective-C.
- Today, I enjoy working with various _web technologies_,
_app development_ on <img src={AppleLogo} alt="Apple" className="inline-icon apple"/> platforms,
 and more recently _server-side_ <img src={SwiftLogo} alt="Swift" className="inline-icon swift" /> Swift.

## Open Source

- In 2012, I open-sourced a [Sass grid framework](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat) that gained considerable momentum in the community.
- Since 2014, I have maintained a handful of open-source iOS and Swift projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/kaishin).
- The latest of which is a [micro-framework](https://github.com/swift-glide/glide) for server-side development.
- Most of my Web development work is done in the open, including [this website](https://github.com/kaishin/redalemeden.com).
